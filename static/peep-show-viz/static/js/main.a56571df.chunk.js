has more lines than Jez. This is the case throughout each series which was a surprise as I considered it around 50/50 when I watched the show. Mark has around twice the amount of "internal thoughts" than Jez. Again this is the case throughout each series. The TV is classed as a character in series one as Mark & Jez converse with it a lot, even to the point of letting it decide (via Bob Ross) if Mark should proclaim his love for Soph or not. This is a theme which didn\'t really occur again in later series. Series one has the fewest number of lines out of all the other series.','Series 2 has the fewest number of interactions between Mark and Jez out of all the other series. Jez has the fewest number of "internal thoughts" in this series. It also introduces us to April who only appears in a single episode but reappears for the final series. Nancy also appears for the first time. This is the series where we see the most of Jeff as the love triangle between him, Mark and Soph intensifies.','This series is the closest Jez comes to having more lines than Mark. Mark has the fewest number of "internal thoughts" in this series. Although mentioned previously, this series is where we see Big Suze for the first time. We also see Big Mad Andy who gladly reappears in later series. Mark and Soph have a lot of lines together as this is the series that culminates in the inadvertent wedding proposal.',"This is the series that has the most characters and it includes some truly memorable ones: Russell \"The Orgazoid\", Matt the personal trainer (who for the record doesn't poo in pools), that dickhead Foz and it's the first appearance of Gerrard. Nancy also reappears after missing series three. This, sadly, is the series in which Super Hans appears the least, he only has 17 lines.","This series is the first appearance of Dobby as Mark tries to move on from his disastrous wedding. We also meet Paula, Toni's sister, again who last appeared in the very first episode.",'Interestingly, Mark speaks to himself more than Jez in this series, the only time this happens. This is probably because Jez is too busy being infatuated with Elena. This is the series with the biggest discrepancy between the number of lines spoken by Mark (42%) and Jez (26%). Super Hans actually talks to Mark more than Jez in this series which continues his development in becoming the "third" character as Soph\'s involvement becomes less and less as the series progress.',"This is the series where we see the most of Gerrard as he and Mark battle it out to be leader of Dobby club. We also have a lot of medical characters as the series starts with the birth of Mark and Sophie's child. We briefly meet Dobby's boyfriend Simon for the first time who'll reappear in the next series. Memorably we also meet Mark's parents for the first time. This is the last series in which Big Suze appears.","In this series we see a lot of interactions between Jez and Dobby as Jez falls in love with her. Jez also has the most number of \"internal thoughts\" compared to other series as he agonises over the fact that he loves Dobby but doesn't want to hurt Mark. Unbelievably, Johnson only has a single, solitary line. But what a line, we'll investigate this later. Big Mad Andy is back and is in desperate need of therapy but Jez's questionable life-coaching will have to suffice. Joshy, Mark's nephew is also included. Although he only has two lines I just wanted to include him sitting on a display toilet as it's hilarious. This is the only series where Soph doesn't appear. Props also to Dave Franks who after being hustled by Mark and Jez into buying bath taps (that almost certainly are not the same ones that Mark Ronson has) he promises not to snitch to Mark's boss, jumpstarts Jez's car and keeps his promise even after finding a child-size poo in one of his display toilets. Also, we can't leave without mentioning that this is the series where Gerrard passes away, and no, it isn't bullshit.",'The final series has the most lines but the fewest number of characters out of all the other series. This is the series in which Mark and Jez converse with each other the most. April reappears after last appearing in series two. Dobby has the fewest amount of lines in this series as she moves on from "just sitting on the sofa watching DVDs and eating lamb pasanda like a pair of zombies".

average sentence length was 6 words during the first episode and likewise for Jez. In fact this holds pretty much throughout except for episodes 4 and 5 where Mark's average drops to 5. So much for him being the more learned of the two.","We see for the very first episode Mark nearly had a 50/50 split internal vs external but this tapered off during the series. In contrast Jez started with very few internal lines, but this increased as the series progressed.","Cancer is mentioned a lot during episode 1 as an argument ensues over the doctor's name for Toni's sister. You can see which episode Johnson makes his grand first appearance and in the final episode we see a lot of soul searching going on as Jez contemplates his own existence after Uncle Ray passes away."],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 6 words during the first episode but only 5 for Jez.","This is the series where Jez has the least amount of internal thoughts compared to other series. This is particularly evident in episodes 2, 4, 5 and 6.","This is the series in which Nancy is introduced for the first time and we can see from Jez's words how much he talks about her. Daryl the racist is prominent in Mark's words from episode 2. This is the same episode where Jez is trying to do the track for Gog's film. Jeff appears at the top of Mark's words on two occasions as he begins to plot his way into breaking up his and Soph's relationship. Jeff also appears in Jez's top words from episode 5 as they form a brief friendship. Student is mentioned by Mark and Jez in episode 4 as they both venture off to Darty, Jez to play a gig (not like Bez) and Mark to stalk April from the shoe shop."],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 8 words during the first episode and 7 for Jez. This series shows a big increase in average sentence lengths compared with the first two series. It even goes up to 9 words per sentence for Mark during the final episode as he grapples with the prospect of proposing to Soph.","We see that Mark continues to have the more internal lines compared to Jez, although Jez has more this series than in series 2 despite the lack of internal thoughts in episode 2. This is probably because of his constant bickering with Super Hans over the name of the pub...","This is the series where we meet Big Suze for the first time. You can see from Jez's top words how besotted he his with her. Mark also mentions her a lot in episode 4 when they spend time together. Mark's words in episode 1 reflect his mildly harrowing experience at the hands of the muggers. Merry is mentioned a lot by both in episode 2 as they prove no help at all with her spiralling mental state. Illness is a theme in episode 3 as Jez locks the sick man of Europe in his room so as not to dampen his mushroom party. There's a legal theme for Jez in episode 5 for obvious reasons and Mark frets about the hotel in the Quantocks in the final episode as this is where he pops the question to Soph, albeit inadvertently."],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 8 words during the first episode but only 6 for Jez. Mark also has a higher average for episodes 2 and 3 but for the rest of the series both characters are tied with an average of 7.",'As usual, Mark has the more internal lines than Jez although during episode 6, "The Wedding", they both have fewer internal lines. This is surprising as usually the more stressful the situation is, the more "internal thoughts" the characters have as they fret over the situation. Perhaps because Mark and Jez are together the whole time meant they were sounding off each other as opposed to internalising their neuroses.','Jez has some strange words. We see "Finger" and "Blair" in episode 1 as Sophie\'s Mum tempts him with some "Blair resignation jam". Russell, episode 4, is Russell "The Orgazoid", one of the most brilliant techno pioneers of all time who Jez gives a "hand" to from time to time. "Dog", "Turkey" and "Mummy" in episode 5 reflect the horror that is Jez killing, attempting to dispose of, barbecuing and finally eating, a dog. The less said about "Melon" in episode 6 the better. Mark\'s words are a bit more conventional. We see him struggling with Project Zeus during episode 2, Johnson\'s unworkable plan where Marketing becomes an arm of Sales which Mark has to pitch to the JLB board. Episode 3 is where Mark joins a gym. "Foz" in episode 4 is the dickhead who used to bully Mark at school.'],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 6 words during the first episode but only 5 for Jez. In fact Jez never has longer sentences than Mark throughout the series. The longest average is Mark's during episode 3, this could be due to him attempting to turn on the charm during his disastrous speed dating encounter.",'Again we see Mark having the more internal lines than Jez. Jez starts with very few but it does increase slightly as the series progresses. Mark actually has closer to a 50/50 split compared to previous series as he grapples with finding "the one", how to defeat Sophie in the post-jilting spin war, controlling Jeremy\'s finances, trying to ignore crystal skulls and contemplating becoming a father.','"Date" is mentioned by both during episode 1 as they venture on a double date to get Mark back in the game. The presence of the word "Police" indicates how that went. We see Mark mention Dobby in episode 2 as this is the series we meet her for the first time. "Elgar" refers to the composer Edward Elgar. Not that Jez turns to classical music, he\'s simply broke and Elgar appears on the back of a \xa320 note. "Gun" is mentioned by both in episode 4 as they find Jez\'s great-aunt\'s revolver which they christen "gunny". Finally, "Orgones" in the final episode refers to Jez joining a cult which according to them are the "invisible molecules of universal life energy which govern our moods and our actions".'],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 8 words during the first episode and 7 for Jez. Episode 4 is one of the very few times Jez beats Mark. Probably because Jez has to improvise as he lies to Gail about seeing Elena behind her back.","As per previous series, Mark has more internal lines than Jez. Jez has very few internal lines during the first episode, probably because he's too busy bemoaning the loss of employment at JLB after his half a day's service to anyone that will listen.",'We can see "Baby" mentioned a lot, by both characters, as the mystery over who the dad concludes. Episode 1 is where JLB closes which we can see is Mark\'s top word. "Dobby" is mentioned a lot by Mark as he tries to win her over. Jeremy mentions Elena and Gail a lot as his dirty love triangle develops. We can see Mark\'s history walk career move from episode 3 as he tries to avoid taking the loss-adjusters job and we can see a party theme from the words in episode 5.'],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 8 words during the first episode and 7 for Jez. Mark beats or equals Jez's average in each episode with 8 being the highest in both episodes 1 and 5 as he tries to converse with the hospital staff and his overbearing father.",'Mark edges the amount of internal lines compared to Jez, but Jez does have more than previous series (in fact this is one of the very few series which has episodes in which Jez has more lines than Mark, see episodes 3 and 4). Episode 4 reduces his ratio a lot but this is the same for Mark as well. I guess being stuck in the "Nether Zone" together limits the internal thoughts each had, taking out their frustration on each other instead.','We can see Mark\'s top words are baby themed as this is the series his son is born. He also talks about Dobby a lot as the battle for leader of Dobby club with Gerrard heats up. "Book" is the top word of both characters in episode 3 as Jez tries to read a "relatively short book" to impress Zahra\'s book group which Mark ends up reading for him. "Kenneth" may seem an odd word, bonus points if you remember what that refers to, I\'d rather not say. "Ben" dominates Jez\'s top words as he obsesses over getting rid of him to be with Zahra. "Suit" is mentioned a fair bit in episode 2 as he tries to get Super Hans\' band to perform in Zoot suits as a deal breaker to sign them to Ben\'s label. The top words are rounded off with Christmas and "Party" type words as the series ends with Christmas dinner and a failure to party hard on New Year\'s Eve.'],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 7 words during the first episode and 6 for Jez. As in previous series, Mark always equals or beats Jez's average, he's particularly wordy in episode 2 which is appropriate considering he's launching his new book.",'Jez really competes with Mark in this series for internal lines. In the final episodes he\'s almost equal as he agonises over the decision to come clean about his love for Dobby. Episode 3 is surprising in that Mark nearly has a 50/50 split internal to external what with fretting over Dobby moving in and trying to avoid being hit by "The Snitch" during paintballing.','We see "Interview", and "Gerrard" are popular for Mark in the first episode as he juggles attending an interview at Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings and delivering the eulogy at Gerrard\'s funeral. "Book" is the third most popular in the second episode as Mark takes the literary world by storm with the release of Business Secrets of the Pharaohs. Episode 3\'s words look odd at first glance until you remember this is the episode with the famous band name game. We can see "Committee" in episode 5 as Mark "The Honourable Man" launches a putsch to take over as chairman of the housing committee. Finally we see "York" in the final episode which refers to Dobby\'s impending move to New York. Jez\'s words are dominated by his career move into life coaching and in the later episodes we can see "Dobby" appearing as he falls in love with her and frets over whether to come clean to Mark.'],["So for example, Mark's average sentence length was 6 words during the first episode and 7 for Jez. In fact this is the only series where Jez has an equal or higher average than Mark. Maybe this is due to him grappling with the prospect of middle age whilst trying to maintain a love triangle.","The final series is no different in that Mark has more internal lines than Jez. Jez's internal thoughts diminish quite a lot towards the end of the series. Maybe this marks the end of Jez's youth and he begins middle age and leaves his partying life behind.",'You\'ll notice "Jerry" mentioned by both characters during the first episode. This isn\'t a typo for Jeremy, it is Mark\'s new cultured flatmate who Jez tries to get kicked out. "Joe" is one of Jez\'s top words throughout the series as he begins a relationship with both him and his girlfriend Megan. "Bank" is mentioned by both at points in the series as Mark begins his new job and Jez becomes an accomplice in robbing it. "Dobby" reappears just for the second episode but Mark finally moves on to his old crush, April. There\'s just the small problem of her being married, see "Angus" in episode 4.']],this.audioAnnotations=[{series:"1",index:546,internal:!0,audio:"sophie.mp3",annotation:"Let's zoom in on some memorable lines from the series.

You know?"}]},Y=function(){this.characterSentiments=["As expected most characters cluster around the neutral sentiment mark. The TV takes the prize for being the most positive. This is probably due to the repeated appearance of Bob Ross, the nicest person ever to appear on television. Jeff is an outlier in episode 5, but to be fair he had just a single line which was obviously not very complimentary. I was surprised to see that the gang of local youths had a positive sentiment in the first episode. This is probably due to them complimenting Mark's clean shirt. You can just make out a positive trend as the episodes progress, up until the final episode where the funeral brings it back down.","Again we see a clustering around the neutral mark although the first episode shows a definite positive skew with, surprisingly, Johnson way out on top courtesy of his pep talk at JLB. We also see other positive outliers but they are mainly the minor characters like Tony, Nim and the registrar from Jez's sham wedding who only had a couple of lines each. Pete from The Executioner's Bong is the most negative (episode 4) presumably because he bumps off Super Hans to get Jez to perform at the gig.","This series is slightly more positive than the first two as you can see clustering just above the neutral mark. Both Sophie and Big Suze maintain a positive sentiment throughout the series. Jez is slightly more positive than Mark, especially in episodes 2 and 4 as he tries to gain favour with Merry and Sarah. Jeff is the big outlier here but again it's a small sample size, his only line being his opinion of Colin Cooper, obviously it isn't very complimentary. The most surprising aspect of this chart is the fact that episode 4 only had 4 characters! This probably explains why that particular episode has the lowest number of lines out of the entire Peep Show oeuvre.","As usual most characters cluster around the neutral mark. Sophie maintains a positive outlook, that is until the fateful jilting on the wedding day. Super Hans goes through the entire gamut of human emotions in this series from very positive in episode 1 (although he only had a couple of lines) to negative in the final episode, probably due to his massive hangover on Mark's wedding day. Lisa is a positive outlier in episode 2 as she joined the Project Zeus work group and got out before Mark turned into the worst boss in human history. Nancy remained positive throughout, the break in series 3 obviously did her good. Not even the Vicar's positive sentiment in episode 6 can save Mark and Sophie's wedding. I think the driver's negative sentiment in the final episode can be excused as he wouldn't have known that Mark was trying to get run over on purpose to avoid getting married.","As expected most characters cluster around the neutral mark. Sophie's sentiment starts off much lower in this series as she deals with the post wedding fiasco. Lisa is the most negative person in the series, this is due to episode 2 where she tells Mark her thoughts on him jilting Sophie. Jeff veers from one extreme to the other due to only having a very few lines in this series. Jez is positive throughout except for episode 4 due to him being incredibly rude to his Mum and trying to play mind games with his new Dad after realising the money pipe is being cut off. Mark stays positive throughout surprisingly. He obviously moves on pretty quickly from the failed wedding.","As expected most characters cluster around the neutral mark but there are some positive outliers, particularly Gail in episode 5. This is the party episode where she proposes to Elena which explains that. The minor characters covered under \"Others\" are also outliers but this is a very small sample size. The negative sentiment in episode 1 comes from a security guard at JLB warning everyone about a fire alarm and the positive sentiment in episode 6 comes from the instructor during Mark's driving test. Elena remains positive throughout the series, she's probably too self-centred to have any negative thoughts. Dobby is quite negative in episode 2 as she finally finds out why Mark is acting strangely. Another negative character is the Tourist from episode 3. This is the guy heckling Mark during his Jack The Ripper tour. Sentiment aside you can see this series had a lot of characters appear in it, especially in the party episode as Mark finally manages to arrange a social gathering.","As usual most characters cluster around the neutral mark but overall we do see it skewing slightly to the positive side, maybe because we have episodes with happier themes such as a new baby, Christmas and New Year's Eve. We can see a couple of positive outliers, Zahra in episode 2 and Sophie in episode 4, although they don't have many lines in these episodes. In fact, Zahra remains positive throughout the series even though she could probably do better for herself in the romance department. Episode 1 is fairly positive on average as this is the episode where Sophie gives birth and we can see most of the hospital staff are being kind, except for the theatre nurse who's probably negative as she warns Mark not to look at the \"goal end\". I was surprised to see the door-to-door seller from episode 3 in neutral sentiment territory, obviously his meekness trying to flog expensive feather dusters helped balance out his aggression when Mark brings him the wrong order at Banditos. The pizza delivery guy in episode 4 has the lowest sentiment average, probably due to him trying to deliver a pizza slice by slice through a letterbox. Ian, Sophie's Father, is also negative in that episode as he's disgusted with Mark for missing his son's christening. I was also surprised to see Mark's Dad come out with a positive average, the sentiment analysis obviously didn't pick up on his thinly veiled sarcasm.","Just as in the previous series we see a slight trend towards an overall positive sentiment. Again we see positive outliers for minor characters and characters with very few lines (Neil in episode 6). The positive \"Others\" in the first two episodes mainly come from Mark's interview rivals at Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings, the Vicar at Gerrard's funeral and a waitress at a caf\xe9. Johnson has the lowest sentiment in the series, his eulogy at Gerrard's funeral obviously didn't go down too well. Big Mad Andy has a negative sentiment in episode 4 as his life spirals out of control and Jez becomes his only hope. He seems to recover in episode 5 but this is only because he offers Jez a corner and a bin bag to sleep in. Mark's highest sentiment average was in episode 2 as he manages to get his book \"published\". Super Hans' sentiment is up and down as he becomes Mark's boss, loses it during paintballing, and tries to engineer his love life via the classified ads.","We see clustering around the neutral mark as before but episode 2 is clearly more positive, probably due to it being Super Hans and Molly's wedding. Only Gregory's aggression, Dobby's lament over her and Mark's past and the driver Frank, who to be fair thought he was going to be murdered, bring it down. Poor Megan goes through the mill in this series. She's struggling with life decisions only to be given false hope from life coach Jez with catastrophic results. By episode 4 her hatred for Jez really shows. Angus and April remain positive despite their marital problems, they are obviously just too nice for it to affect how they deal with others. The minor characters under \"Others\" are again outliers due to the small number of lines that they have. It dips from positive (the registrar at Super Hans and Molly's wedding) to negative (the TV in the very last episode delcaring that wolves have been reintroduced)."]},q=function(){this.annotations=["There is a sense of prevarication in these words.
