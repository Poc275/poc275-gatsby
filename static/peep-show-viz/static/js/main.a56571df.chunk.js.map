This is the case throughout each series which was a surprise as I considered it around 50/50 when I watched the show. Mark has around twice the amount of \\\"internal thoughts\\\" than Jez. Again this is the case throughout each series. The TV is classed as a character in series one as Mark & Jez converse with it a lot, even to the point of letting it decide (via Bob Ross) if Mark should proclaim his love for Soph or not. This is a theme which didn't really occur again in later series. Series one has the fewest number of lines out of all the other series.\",\r\n        \"Series 2 has the fewest number of interactions between Mark and Jez out of all the other series. Jez has the fewest number of \\\"internal thoughts\\\" in this series. It also introduces us to April who only appears in a single episode but reappears for the final series. Nancy also appears for the first time. This is the series where we see the most of Jeff as the love triangle between him, Mark and Soph intensifies.\",\r\n        \"This series is the closest Jez comes to having more lines than Mark. Mark has the fewest number of \\\"internal thoughts\\\" in this series. Although mentioned previously, this series is where we see Big Suze for the first time. We also see Big Mad Andy who gladly reappears in later series. Mark and Soph have a lot of lines together as this is the series that culminates in the inadvertent wedding proposal.\",\r\n        \"This is the series that has the most characters and it includes some truly memorable ones: Russell \\\"The Orgazoid\\\", Matt the personal trainer (who for the record doesn't poo in pools), that dickhead Foz and it's the first appearance of Gerrard. Nancy also reappears after missing series three. This, sadly, is the series in which Super Hans appears the least, he only has 17 lines.\",\r\n        \"This series is the first appearance of Dobby as Mark tries to move on from his disastrous wedding. We also meet Paula, Toni's sister, again who last appeared in the very first episode.\",\r\n        \"Interestingly, Mark speaks to himself more than Jez in this series, the only time this happens. This is probably because Jez is too busy being infatuated with Elena. This is the series with the biggest discrepancy between the number of lines spoken by Mark (42%) and Jez (26%).

We also have a lot of medical characters as the series starts with the birth of Mark and Sophie's child. We briefly meet Dobby's boyfriend Simon for the first time who'll reappear in the next series. Memorably we also meet Mark's parents for the first time. This is the last series in which Big Suze appears.\",\r\n        \"In this series we see a lot of interactions between Jez and Dobby as Jez falls in love with her.

Unbelievably, Johnson only has a single, solitary line. But what a line, we'll investigate this later. Big Mad Andy is back and is in desperate need of therapy but Jez's questionable life-coaching will have to suffice. Joshy, Mark's nephew is also included. Although he only has two lines I just wanted to include him sitting on a display toilet as it's hilarious. This is the only series where Soph doesn't appear. Props also to Dave Franks who after being hustled by Mark and Jez into buying bath taps (that almost certainly are not the same ones that Mark Ronson has) he promises not to snitch to Mark's boss, jumpstarts Jez's car and keeps his promise even after finding a child-size poo in one of his display toilets. Also, we can't leave without mentioning that this is the series where Gerrard passes away, and no, it isn't bullshit.\",\r\n        \"The final series has the most lines but the fewest number of characters out of all the other series.

Mark and Jez endure awkward situations: Mark admires his boss, Alan Johnson, and struggles to work out whether or not he is sexually attracted to him. Jez remembers engaging in fellatio with Super Hans during a drug binge. Sophie beats Mark to a promotion, so Mark and Jez desperately team up to prank call Sophie, which leads to her shooting them with a pellet gun. They also launch a pepper spray attack on Super Hans, who has begun a fling with Toni.

Nancy asks Jez to marry her, for visa reasons, and Jez accepts gleefully; Mark gets Super Hans to lie to Jez and say that she had sex with him, but after they see his reaction they cannot go through with it. Jez and Nancy do get married despite Mark's efforts, but after they decide to start having sex again Jez admits to Nancy, who is now his wife, that he hooked up with Toni.

Jez has a fling with Mark's sister, while Mark falls in love with Suze. Jez serves on a jury and has a date with the female defendant. In the last episode, Mark plans to propose to Sophie but changes his mind upon realising that they have nothing in common. Nonetheless he agrees to marry her to avoid \\\"embarrassment\\\" after she accidentally finds his engagement ring and accepts a proposal which he had not actually made. Jez's efforts to get back together with Suze are hindered somewhat by Hans's attempts to go cold turkey.\",\r\n        \"During this series, recently engaged Mark and Sophie visit Sophie's parents, and Jez has sex with Sophie's mother.

The plan backfires when Jez accidentally kills the pet dog of one of the girls and the family find out when a series of attempts to cover it up lead to him eating it. As the wedding approaches, Jez is having difficulty juggling a hungover Super Hans, the wedding, Nancy, and his desperate need to urinate. After several attempts to avoid marrying, including proposing marriage to a member of staff in a local cafe, stepping out in front of a car, and hiding in the church, Mark, with visible reluctance, marries Sophie. However, realising he was trying to get out of marrying her by hiding, she runs out on him after the ceremony, planning to seek an annulment because Mark is \\\"horrible\\\".\",\r\n        \"Much of the series revolves around Mark's search for \\\"the one\\\". His first date since his wedding is a double date which goes wrong due to going to a boring play, his date being uninterested in him and then returning to the house to find a burglar. He asks out the IT girl, Dobby, although the date ends badly when they find a vomiting Sophie in the toilets, who reveals to Dobby that she is married to him. Dobby remains interested, even when Mark rejects her offer to be his date at his upcoming birthday party to take a young Australian woman whom he had recently met whilst speed dating. Jez runs out of money and steals from Johnson's credit card and is temporarily evicted by Mark. Jez asks Big Suze if he can stay with her and Johnson, but is rejected. He tries to obtain money from his mother after his great aunt dies, which reveals their strained relationship.

Jez meets Elena, a beautiful young European woman and occasional marijuana dealer who lives in their building. Jeremy quickly falls in love with her, but things deteriorate when it is revealed that Elena has a long-term partner, Gail, who is returning to London. Mark looks for work, starting a company with an ill-equipped Johnson, almost landing his dream job as a guide for historic walks, then becoming a waiter in Gail's Mexican restaurant—all the while trying to get anywhere with Dobby. To resolve their woman troubles, Jeremy and Mark host a party, which ends in Jeremy trying to rekindle his love for Elena, Mark failing to win over Dobbie, and Gail and Elena deciding to enter into a civil partnership. Mark pledges to take driving lessons in order to drive Sophie to the hospital when the baby arrives, but lies to her when he fails his test. Jeremy is upset over losing Elena, especially after she reveals that she is moving to Quebec with Gail. Sophie goes into labour early, and with Mark forced to reveal he cannot drive, a drunk Jeremy attempts to drive Sophie to the hospital and nearly runs Gail over. Jeremy admits that he and Elena were having an affair, then Sophie drives herself to the hospital with the two boys in the back seat.\",\r\n        \"Zahra and her boyfriend Ben are introduced, whom Jez meets while Sophie is giving birth. Jez is instantly attracted to Zahra and is selfishly pleased when he discovers that Ben is in a coma, potentially making Zahra single. However, Ben recovers fully, and, as thanks for being so friendly to Zahra, offers Jez a job with his record company, which Jez accepts as he hopes it will allow him to get closer to Zahra. The job does not go well, and his attempts to sign up his and Super Hans's band fails badly and ends up with him being fired from the band. Mark finally beats off competition from Gerard to become Dobby's boyfriend, although he continues to behave awkwardly in her company. Gail sacks Mark from his job at the restaurant. Jez pretends to be an intellectual in order to impress Zahra, which enables him to have sex with her. When Mark comes to meet him the next morning the two find themselves locked in Zahra's flat, causing Ben to discover them and Mark to miss his son's christening. Jez, Hans, Dobby, Mark, Mark's sister and parents all have Christmas dinner at Jez and Mark's. After Zahra tells Jez that she has split from Ben, Jez accepts her offer to move in with her. Mark needs to salvage his relationship with Dobby, and asks her to move in with him, to which she agrees. Zahra rejects Jez after she learns he has been flirting with Super Hans's girlfriend, dumping him.\",\r\n        \"The series begins with Mark waiting for Dobby to move in, while Dobby waits for Jez to move out. Mark suspects that Dobby will never move in, and that Gerard is trying to steal her from him; however, Gerard dies of flu. Jez and Super Hans amicably end their band, and this causes Jez to contemplate his life so far: he eventually agrees to undertake therapy sessions, which are paid for by Mark. Impressed by the therapy, Jez decides to become a life coach, but he fails a course of questionable value. Mark then gives Jez a fake life coach certificate and he begins \\\"coaching\\\" anyone who will let him, causing emotional and personal harm. Mark writes a book, which is published by an incompetent vanity publisher. Mark, Dobby, Jez and Hans go paintballing. Mark gets a job at the bathroom supplies company where Hans works, but is soon sacked. He also starts an evening course to gain an MBA. Jez falls in love with Dobby and declares his feelings, as does Mark. While Mark and Jez fight, Dobby leaves the scene and heads to New York, where she has a new job.\",\r\n        \"The final series opens with Mark and Jez meeting for the first time since their fight over Dobby, with Mark still bearing a grudge over the role Jez played in his break-up with her. Jez is living in Super Hans's bathroom, while Mark has a new flatmate. After reconciling, Jez moves back in with Mark and they go back to their old ways. Jez begins a relationship with a younger man, Joe, and also has sex with Joe's girlfriend Megan. Mark seeks out April (previously seen only in a single episode in series 2), whom he always thought to be his perfect woman, despite her now being married. Dobby has moved to New York and has a new boyfriend. He beats up Mark when he discovers Mark had been tracking Dobby's movements. Hans marries Molly in Norfolk. Sophie turns up at the flat depressed and appears to have a drink problem. She is in a relationship with a man whom she thinks is having an affair. She offers Mark a chance to give their relationship another go, which he initially accepts, but Mark decides to try and break up April's marriage and start a new life with her. In the final episode, all the duo's past lies and selfish decisions catch up with them. Mark loses his job at a bank because of a loan he gave Jez previously (ironically, to exploit him) without asking for correct identification paperwork, and he is replaced by his rival Jeff. Joe leaves Jez after his lies about him being popular and young are caught out, and Jez claims he is tired of partying all the time. Super Hans's wife is upset because he is unwilling to stop his old disreputable lifestyle, and after he kidnaps and threatens April's husband, she finally leaves him. Super Hans ends up leaving for Macedonia to open a moped hire business and leaves Mark and Jez right back where they always end up due to their bad choices, with Mark losing his newest relationship and job, while Jez remains stuck in a rut with no prospects. It ends with the two watching TV together, asking and answering inane questions, with Jez thinking to himself how they both \\\"love each other really\\\" and Mark reminding himself that he \\\"simply

The TV takes the prize for being the most positive. This is probably due to the repeated appearance of Bob Ross, the nicest person ever to appear on television. Jeff is an outlier in episode 5, but to be fair he had just a single line which was obviously not very complimentary. I was surprised to see that the gang of local youths had a positive sentiment in the first episode. This is probably due to them complimenting Mark's clean shirt. You can just make out a positive trend as the episodes progress, up until the final episode where the funeral brings it back down.\",\r\n        \"Again we see a clustering around the neutral mark although the first episode shows a definite positive skew with, surprisingly, Johnson way out on top courtesy of his pep talk at JLB. We also see other positive outliers but they are mainly the minor characters like Tony, Nim and the registrar from Jez's sham wedding who only had a couple of lines each. Pete from The Executioner's Bong is the most negative (episode 4) presumably because he bumps off Super Hans to get Jez to perform at the gig.\",\r\n        \"This series is slightly more positive than the first two as you can see clustering just above the neutral mark. Both Sophie and Big Suze maintain a positive sentiment throughout the series. Jez is slightly more positive than Mark, especially in episodes 2 and 4 as he tries to gain favour with Merry and Sarah. Jeff is the big outlier here but again it's a small sample size, his only line being his opinion of Colin Cooper, obviously it isn't very complimentary. The most surprising aspect of this chart is the fact that episode 4 only had 4 characters! This probably explains why that particular episode has the lowest number of lines out of the entire Peep Show oeuvre.\",\r\n        \"As usual most characters cluster around the neutral mark. Sophie maintains a positive outlook, that is until the fateful jilting on the wedding day. Super Hans goes through the entire gamut of human emotions in this series from very positive in episode 1 (although he only had a couple of lines) to negative in the final episode, probably due to his massive hangover on Mark's wedding day. Lisa is a positive outlier in episode 2 as she joined the Project Zeus work group and got out before Mark turned into the worst boss in human history. Nancy remained positive throughout, the break in series 3 obviously did her good. Not even the Vicar's positive sentiment in episode 6 can save Mark and Sophie's wedding. I think the driver's negative sentiment in the final episode can be excused as he wouldn't have known that Mark was trying to get run over on purpose to avoid getting married.\",\r\n        \"As expected most characters cluster around the neutral mark. Sophie's sentiment starts off much lower in this series as she deals with the post wedding fiasco. Lisa is the most negative person in the series, this is due to episode 2 where she tells Mark her thoughts on him jilting Sophie. Jeff veers from one extreme to the other due to only having a very few lines in this series. Jez is positive throughout except for episode 4 due to him being incredibly rude to his Mum and trying to play mind games with his new Dad after realising the money pipe is being cut off. Mark stays positive throughout surprisingly. He obviously moves on pretty quickly from the failed wedding.\",\r\n        \"As expected most characters cluster around the neutral mark but there are some positive outliers, particularly Gail in episode 5. This is the party episode where she proposes to Elena which explains that. The minor characters covered under \\\"Others\\\" are also outliers but this is a very small sample size. The negative sentiment in episode 1 comes from a security guard at JLB warning everyone about a fire alarm and the positive sentiment in episode 6 comes from the instructor during Mark's driving test. Elena remains positive throughout the series, she's probably too self-centred to have any negative thoughts. Dobby is quite negative in episode 2 as she finally finds out why Mark is acting strangely. Another negative character is the Tourist from episode 3. This is the guy heckling Mark during his Jack The Ripper tour. Sentiment aside you can see this series had a lot of characters appear in it, especially in the party episode as Mark finally manages to arrange a social gathering.\",\r\n        \"As usual most characters cluster around the neutral mark but overall we do see it skewing slightly to the positive side, maybe because we have episodes with happier themes such as a new baby, Christmas and New Year's Eve. We can see a couple of positive outliers, Zahra in episode 2 and Sophie in episode 4, although they don't have many lines in these episodes. In fact, Zahra remains positive throughout the series even though she could probably do better for herself in the romance department. Episode 1 is fairly positive on average as this is the episode where Sophie gives birth and we can see most of the hospital staff are being kind, except for the theatre nurse who's probably negative as she warns Mark not to look at the \\\"goal end\\\". I was surprised to see the door-to-door seller from episode 3 in neutral sentiment territory, obviously his meekness trying to flog expensive feather dusters helped balance out his aggression when Mark brings him the wrong order at Banditos. The pizza delivery guy in episode 4 has the lowest sentiment average, probably due to him trying to deliver a pizza slice by slice through a letterbox. Ian, Sophie's Father, is also negative in that episode as he's disgusted with Mark for missing his son's christening. I was also surprised to see Mark's Dad come out with a positive average, the sentiment analysis obviously didn't pick up on his thinly veiled sarcasm.\",\r\n        \"Just as in the previous series we see a slight trend towards an overall positive sentiment. Again we see positive outliers for minor characters and characters with very few lines (Neil in episode 6). The positive \\\"Others\\\" in the first two episodes mainly come from Mark's interview rivals at Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings, the Vicar at Gerrard's funeral and a waitress at a café. Johnson has the lowest sentiment in the series, his eulogy at Gerrard's funeral obviously didn't go down too well. Big Mad Andy has a negative sentiment in episode 4 as his life spirals out of control and Jez becomes his only hope. He seems to recover in episode 5 but this is only because he offers Jez a corner and a bin bag to sleep in. Mark's highest sentiment average was in episode 2 as he manages to get his book \\\"published\\\". Super Hans' sentiment is up and down as he becomes Mark's boss, loses it during paintballing, and tries to engineer his love life via the classified ads.\",\r\n        \"We see clustering around the neutral mark as before but episode 2 is clearly more positive, probably due to it being Super Hans and Molly's wedding. Only Gregory's aggression, Dobby's lament over her and Mark's past and the driver Frank, who to be fair thought he was going to be murdered, bring it down. Poor Megan goes through the mill in this series. She's struggling with life decisions only to be given false hope from life coach Jez with catastrophic results. By episode 4 her hatred for Jez really shows. Angus and April remain positive despite their marital problems, they are obviously just too nice for it to affect how they deal with others. The minor characters under \\\"Others\\\" are again outliers due to the small number of lines that they have. It dips from positive (the registrar at Super Hans and Molly's wedding) to negative (the TV in the very last episode delcaring that wolves have been reintroduced).\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SentimentAnnotations;","const WordAnnotations = function() {\r\n\r\n    this.annotations = [\r\n        \"There is a sense of prevarication in these words.

Over use of swearing can sometimes \r\n                            be a ploy to get a cheap laugh out of a bad line, but I believe Peep Show uses swearing in a much more intelligent way so I was interested \r\n                            to see how often it is used.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>Surprisingly, you get at least 25 swear words per episode, often a lot more. This seems high but there were over a quarter of a million words \r\n                            throughout the entire nine series and with just over 2000 total swear words, it equates to less than 1%.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>The highlighted bars are from the current series but there is no clear trend either per series or overall. What we tend to see is more \r\n                            swearing during acutely stressful or embarrassing situations, particularly when it is Mark who is under stress.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    <div className=\"step\" data-step=\"8\" data-trigger=\"swear-bars-highlight\">\r\n                        <p>Here we have highlighted the 90th percentile and above and can see they are almost exclusively episodes where Mark is stressed \r\n                            out, more than usual anyway. With the exception of \"The Interview\" episode where it was probably Jez that was stressed a bit more than Mark as he had \r\n                            to go to an interview at JLB, the rest are due to Mark. \"Conference\" is when Mark has to pitch the unworkable \"Project Zeus\" to the JLB \r\n                            board. \"The Wedding\" is the sweariest episode in the entire show, for obvious reasons. \"Quantocking II\" is where Mark finds out Jez is in love \r\n                            with Dobby and plans to steal her from him and the final episode, \"Are We Going To Be Alright?\", is where Mark gets sacked from the bank for \r\n                            approving Jez for a dodgy loan and thinks he's won April only to find out Super Hans and Jez have kidnapped Angus.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                </article>\r\n\r\n                <figure id=\"fig\" style={{ display: showVisual }}>\r\n                    {visualisation}\r\n                </figure>\r\n            </section>\r\n        </main>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Explorer;\r\n","import Sentiment from './visualisations/sentiment/Sentiment';\r\n\r\nfunction Test() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Sentiment />\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Test;\r\n","// import logo from './logo.svg';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Welcome from './Welcome';\nimport { Switch, Route, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { CSSTransition, TransitionGroup } from 'react-transition-group';\nimport Explorer from './Explorer';\nimport Test from './Test';\n\nfunction App() {\n  let location = useLocation();\n\n  return (\n    <TransitionGroup>\n      <CSSTransition \n        key={location.key}\n        classNames=\"fade\"\n        timeout={1300}\n      >\n        <Switch location={location}>\n          <Route exact path=\"/\">\n            <Welcome />\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route path=\"/:series/explore\">\n            <Explorer />\n          </Route>\n\n          <Route path=\"/:series/test\">\n            <Test />\n          </Route>\n        </Switch>\n      </CSSTransition>\n    </TransitionGroup>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport './index.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <Router>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route path=\"*\">\n          <App />\n        </Route>\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
