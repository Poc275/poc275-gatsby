1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Do I look like the kind of man who goes to wicked parties? Why don't you ask Toni?,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I did actually but she said no. But it's better this way, two lads, we gotta get out there, grooving, doing it, you know? It's been a long time for either of us. I haven't had my oats in something like, two weeks!",Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Nine months and thirteen days.,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,I mean look at us!†People are gonna think we spend the whole day wanking.,Supermarket

1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh Mark, come on man, let it go.",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,What? Why do you have to have a huge can of lager that makes you really really drunk? What's wrong with moderation?,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah but what if you want to get Sophie back home? You might want to get her all lathered up.,Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,That's not going to be happening any time soon.,Supermarket

1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Mm-hm.,Supermarket

1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"That's right. No queues, so who exactly is winning then?",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Mark,"OK, well, I'm here, so I'll just sit here and drink. No one can stop me doing that. Just drink myself to death. I bet he gets sex tonight and I have to listen to it through the wall. Maybe she might go to the bathroom and accidentally come into my room. And then what? She fucks you? No, she says ""whoops"" and goes out. Stop doing this to yourself.",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Others,"So, safe party. Super safe!",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, OK, playing it cool? All right, how about I go a little Oscar Wilde on your ass?",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Others,"So I always go for the first pressing. I mean why wait until everyone else has had their fun with the olives, right?",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,What's her problem? This is the 21st Century. Olive oil is a perfectly acceptable topic.,Party
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Someone here's got psoriasis, one of the less common skin ailments. Basic yeast infection, rash if you're thinking glamorous, athlete's foot if you're not. A fellow migraine sufferer?

1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Yeah, sure.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,So who exactly are you trying to bone tonight?,Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Oh I'm not in the game. If I can get my shopping home intact, I'll be happy.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Just like, be honest about it, you know. I mean, let's line up, two naked rows, best-looking people can pick the best-looking, the dregs get the dregs and we can all just go home early and get it over with.",Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"That, to me, is a very attractive system you're proposing.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"And it saves them having to humiliate themselves. I mean, check out this guy.",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This is great. Knew this would pay off. Talking's bullshit. ""Yeah, I did this"", ""I go there"". OK, there's a new guy in town. Probably just a friend. Yeah, me, her and her friend. Quite nice actually. Hey! That's a foul. Fuck! God, she must be loving this. I feel so cheap. I really thought we had something.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"So you work in an office and you've got, like, your computer and your desk. God, that is so fucking weird!",Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Yeah, well you know, everything's decaying, so the way I see it. Has there ever been a better time to save up for a very comfortable sofa?",Party
1,3,Mark,Mark,"She's a teenager for God's sake, Mark. You'll get castrated by the menfolk. Maybe she's a- Oh, God.",Party

1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Maybe... I could bring someone along?,Party
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Er... I mean... I guess,Party
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I know, I'll call Toni. Yeah, no, this is perfect cause I'll just say ""Me, Mark and Valerie are off down the Lazerbowl. Do you want a piece of the action?"" and she'll be like ""Hell yeah! Why the hell not?""",Party
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,You think so?,Party
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"Yeah, so he was all ""Do you want a piece of the action?"" and I was all ""Hell yeah! I mean this is definitely not the rehearsal. Why not go to the Lazerbowl with the kid next door? I mean honestly, why the hell not?""",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"I've got to take Jeremy's advice more often. I'm out on a date with a teenage goth, smoking pot in the Lazerbowl toilets. This is it. This is literally it. This is the sort of thing people do when they're having a good time.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Toni,I don't know if,Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Mark,It's good stuff Mark. I strongly advise you... toke it.,Lazerbowl

1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Don't poke my eyes! Don't poke my eyes!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Are you getting visuals?,Lazerbowl

1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"No of course no. Look, everything's going brilliantly, right? Now we've got to work together as a team. Work things up into a bit of a lather, yeah? Follow my lead.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,Jez is so great. He's like an idiot savant but not so stupid. I bet he's totally sorting this whole night in his head for us right now.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I could say we've both got enormous cocks, might be the clincher.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,This is great! Isn't it?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,This is so...†it! I'm having a just... great time.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"Great. So, girls, what's the weirdest place you've ever... done it?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"I had a steward eat me at the multi-faith area at Dubai airport. God, that was depressing.",Lazerbowl

1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Right, I mean what's her problem? I've never heard of Level 42 either.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Guys, I'm so sorry.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Hey, gutter boy. You are allowed to hit the pins, you know.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,You are?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"In some bowling alleys, you're actually encouraged.",Lazerbowl

1,3,Sophie,Mark,I've been with Jeff.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,Jeff?!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,All right Mark.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This should be in the bag. She's come to the Lazerbowl with me, why isn't this in the bag? She looks like she hates me.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"What? It's eat as much as you can, you know.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"No, it's eat as much as you†like. There's no competitive element implied.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"At £3.99, I know who's winning.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"How dare she criticise Peter Gabriel! With her little ""screw me"" haircut, and all so ""nee-nee-nee-ee."" You know he single-handedly created WOMAD.",Lazerbowl

1,3,Mark,Valerie,Yeah it's great.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Jeff,So do you guys get pissed at the Christmas party and photocopy your arses?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Yeah, Jeff did do that, actually.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,Yeah but that was before everyone else started doing it.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,No that's true. You were something of a trendsetter in that area.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Valerie,"So, Valerie, you still at school or what?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,"She's at college, actually.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Jeff,Sixth form college.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,Yeah that's still college.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Valerie,Right. So what's you favourite subject then?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Jeff,I'm sure Valerie doesn't want to talk about subjects. She's bowling.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Valerie,"Sure, sure, of course, yeah. So who do you think is best in S-Club, then?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Jeff,"Oh, I'm not really into them, but I hear they have a big gay following.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"For the worst thing that could possibly happen, this is going extremely well.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Maybe I can just really get into Peter Gabriel and go mental and marry her and cut off from society and just have lots of sex and agree with her about everything.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"I'm bursting! This is why you should stick to the little cans, ah, the simple pleasures. Oh",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,Having a good night?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,"Uh, yeah, yeah.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,Nice bowling. You seem to have narrowed it down to the one lane anyway.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,"Well you know, it's just a bit of fun.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh God, go. I'm never going to be able to go now. Why can't I go?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"Yeah, just a bit of fun. Nice after a lovely Italian and a couple bottles of wine.",Lazerbowl

1,3,Jeff,Mark,"She loved it, actually.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"It's all- Shit! Waterfalls, nothing! Pretend you've finished. Ahh!",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"Mark, can you break a tenner for the johnny machine.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,What? You-,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"Actually, I think I'm all right. I'm thinking a couple of packs of normal. Knobblies are a bit of a con, aren't they? Maybe a couple of fruities for a laugh.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"She hates fruit, except pears. If there's pear flavour, I'm fucked.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Tony,"Well I can't stop hanging on for you because I never started hanging on for you! Well, here's the headlines, buddy! I can do who I want, when I want, where I want, and I will, OK?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Mark,This is not the rehearsal.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Come on, clock's ticking. Got to raise my game. Think witty. Charming and witty. And sexy.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,Sorry about that. Listen,Lazerbowl

1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Oh right, well I suppose... He asked me.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,He asked you? Of course. Is that all it takes?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,It certainly does help.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,I mean I did actually ask you myself.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Yes, but I was already... and I didn't say anything because well, you know. So, Valerie seems nice.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, Valerie, she's nothing.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, right.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,That didn't sound good.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"I mean... It's just... A little nice out. I'm a friend of her brother's. He's a total wanker, actually. So, have you had a good time on your... date?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Yes, I mean yeah. You know what you're getting with Pizza Hut.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,Ha! Idiot! I win!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Cool. So, old seat sniffer, he didn't sniff any of the seats or anything, didn't he?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"That's a joke, Mark. A rumour that I don't think is appropriate for you to... Jeff's a nice guy.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,A nice guy? You should've,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"I'm having a nice time so let's just leave it at that, OK?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,You're having a good time.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,Yeah.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Good, because obviously, I'm having a great time too.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Well that makes two of us because like I said, I'm having a great time.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,She's not going to do it. They won't do it.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, fuck you Lord of Death. I'm still full of piss and vinegar. Mmm, doing it with a sexy neighbour. Ow! That... why is she sucking it? Maybe she's practising for my... are you allowed to say when it hurts?",Toni's Flat

2,1,Dance Teacher,Others,"Now, as we move into red, let it all go my super-luminaries. Open the box.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, sure, honey. Appear to be opening the box while in fact, the lid stays very firmly on. She's buying it! God, it's so easy being a freak, no wonder they're ten a penny. I should get extra marks for not feeling a fucking thing.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Sophie,Mark,"†Mark, how are you feeling? You looked like you were really getting in touch with something in there.",Pub

2,1,Jeremy,Nancy,†Oh blimey.,Pub
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy,†I think that's fantastic.,Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy,"†No, brilliant. I mean, that's brilliant, honey. You're such a bloody trooper.",Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy,†Well that's when I decided to live in the open 24/7. No more crap,Pub

2,1,Jeremy,Nancy,†Exactly. We're open in our relationship.,Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy,†And we're open with other people.,Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy,†We... are?,Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy,"†That's what we're all about, right, Jez? Freedom?",Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy,"†Sure, Nance, sure, yeah. Freedom, loyalty, commitment, monogamy. In a sense, that's the final taboo, isn't it?",Pub
2,1,Toni,Jeremy,"†That's funny, you weren't worried about monogamy the other day when you came round and told me you were in love with me.",Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Toni,"†Right, yeah. I mean, that was a bit of a- not mistake, or joke, but just... wrong. I mean, you can't love two people at once.",Pub
2,1,Toni,Jeremy,"†Yes, you can.",Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy,†Of course you can.,Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy,"†No, sure, obviously you can, but you don't. You work out who you like best and then you pretend not to like anyone else.",Pub

2,1,Sophie,Mark,"†Well, um, I mean, it depends what type of love you're talking about...",Pub
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, but what does she really think? Probably shouldn't look again today. More than once every four hours would be obsessive.",Pub
2,1,Sophie,Sophie,†...very confusing.,Pub
2,1,Mark,Sophie,"†Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Tell you what, I'm going off to the bog. For a wee!",Pub
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Conversation is rubbish. You could literally waste years talking to someone and never get the bottom line. OK, still nothing interesting in the outbox. She needs to express her feelings more. Ha! Just, check the inbox. A-ha! Jeff. Just arrived. What's your game? ""Soph, just a thought, do you fancy going punting on Saturday? Thought it might be a laugh. Bell me. Love Jeffy."" Jeffy, ugh. Punting? Punting equals shunting. Got to get in first, ask her out on a day trip. What's a banker?",Pub

2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit. Got to stop this. Grab the wheel, cause an accident. There's definitely a taboo against that. Plus, if she got disfigured, she'd be more likely to stick with me. But what if I came off worse, lost a limb? I'm punching above my weight as it is.",Nancy's VW

2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn," Yeah, nice idea but no stuff, so we'd better be off.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," On a day like this, what stuff do you need? ""Sorry, I can't possibly enjoy the fresh water against my skin, I haven't got my stuff.""",Gwyn's Cabin

2,1,Nancy,Gwyn," This place is amazing, Gwyn. How can you afford it all?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy, I guess I've just been very lucky. Money's an energy and lots of it has always flowed towards me. Particularly after my parents died.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn, Cosmic.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," Yeah well, that might sound funny to you, but it was actually quite a painful time.",Gwyn's Cabin

2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn,This place has great energy.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," Yeah. I remember when I first spent time down here. I was 14 years old, and I came down here all alone, just with a candle and an old, old copy of Henry Miller. And I just had the most amazing wank. I mean it really just bust me open. I couldn't believe that I had this instrument right there. Isn't it amazing, that first big wank?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Nancy,Gwyn," Oh, yeah.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn," Oh, yeah.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Gwyn, Yeah.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy," I tell you what we used to do down here when we were kids. Spin the bottle, that whole thing. Hey. Why not? Why don't we just fucking go for it?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Nancy,Gwyn, Yeah!,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy," OK, so, whoever's on kisses whoever the bottle stops at. Cool?",Gwyn's Cabin

2,1,Mark,Jeremy,"†Me too, I love breaking them.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, no! No! No! I can't believe this is happening. He doesn't even floss. I tell him, but he won't. Jesus, when can we stop?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Don't stop first. If I don't mind looking gay, I'll seem the most hetero. At least it's Mark. Oh, Jesus, it's Mark!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark,"†Wow, Mark! Well done.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie,†Thank you.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy,"†OK, so, Nancy's on.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,This is probably how the Manson family started.,Gwyn's Cabin

2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn,"†Uh hey, come on, folks, there are other people waiting to Hmm, ok.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,"The squalor. It's happening. It's Woodstock, it's Altamont, it's My Lai. Although, Sophie's hand on my thigh, maybe there's a time and a place for squalor.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie,"†Sophie, your hand... oh, look. Gwyn's feeling me up.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,I'm Louis Theroux. I'm Louis Theroux and his wry smile at the orgy.,Gwyn's Cabin

2,1,Mark,Sophie,"†No, no, this is great. I'm, I'm into this.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark,†Because I'm not sure I'm into this.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie,†You're not? Brilliant.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Sure, an orgy sounds great, but you're basically just multiplying the number of people you're not going to be able to look in the eye afterwards.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark,"†I suppose it would be interesting to try something like that one day, but you've got to think there are inevitably going to be complications.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie,"†If you're into something like that, you probably see the inevitable complications as part of the fun.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark,†Yeah.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie,†Isn't this beautiful?,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark,†It really is.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie,†Here you go.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, you can keep your VD and your barricades and your talking and your drugs, I'm back to basics: moonlight, lake, cardigan. Perfect. I should do something romantic. Surely I'm not about to sing.",Gwyn's Cabin

2,2,Mark,Jeremy," That's very kind of you Jez, but you don't want to overstretch yourself.",Indian Restaurant
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Bollocks. I'm a very generous guy. Daryl's bringing his cor anglais, Nancy's singing, what are you going to do?",Indian Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Heh, well, we did once talk about me doing a kind of Jean-Michel Jarre thing on the keyboards.",Indian Restaurant
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Mm-hm. Or, I was sort of hoping you'd say you want to be the manager. Yeah? You could order me around, which you'd enjoy, but I'd be your boss. Could be kind of confusing, in a good way.",Indian Restaurant

2,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,What am I gonna tell Gog? What happened to all the time? Where did all the time go? We had loads of time!,Recording Studio

2,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,God that's terrible. It's worse than Daryl's bloody cor anglais. Oh they're useless. I wish they were all robots. I wish I was a robot. Maybe I could punch through a wall.,Recording Studio

2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy," What, so next you're gonna boot me out for not wearing a jacket and tie?",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Jez, is there anything I can...?",Recording Studio
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," It's under control, Mark, OK, everything's under control, will you please get back behind the glass?",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," But, as your manager, I just",Recording Studio
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Just get back behind the glass. There is a very clear, if invisible line, here be beauty, there be... pie charts. OK?",Recording Studio
2,2,Others,Jeremy," Look, I've been here since eight, I'm just going to go grab a coffee, all right?",Recording Studio
2,2,Super Hans,Others," Yeah well, if you're leaving now, don't even fucking dream of coming back!",Recording Studio

2,2,Mark,Daryl, Exactly my feeling. Exactly.,Re-enactment Site
2,2,Daryl,Mark," I mean, democracy's all very well, but it's weak and it's decadent. You need a strong leader.",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Mark,Daryl, Uh...,Re-enactment Site
2,2,Daryl,Mark, I'm in character.,Re-enactment Site

2,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh God, I'm even boring when I'm a Nazi.",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Daryl,Mark, Jesus! Classic rubbernecker. Absolutely no interest in military history. Might as well be checking out fucking seed drills down a farm museum.,Re-enactment Site
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Still, it's nice to get out the city, isn't it?",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Oh yeah, it's nice to get away from it all, isn't it, the work, the smog, the graffiti.",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Yeah, the traffic, the noise, the hassle.",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Car alarms, the cashpoints, the blacks, the Pakis, the Jews.",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Oh uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's what we all want, a racially pure nation.",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Exactly. I mean all we're saying is England for the English, right?",Re-enactment Site
2,2,Mark,Daryl, You mean Germany for the Germans? You mean- this is- are we-?,Re-enactment Site

2,2,Mark,Jeremy, Uh-huh.,Living Room
2,2,Mark,Mark,I've got to cut the link. Daryl is definitely beyond.,Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," So, rest of the money should be rolling in soon, which is just as well!",Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, Uh-huh.,Living Room
2,2,Mark,Mark,"Or maybe I'm just overreacting. Maybe everyone does it now, and it's cool and Ali G and I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud, as usual.",Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Mark, like I said, sorry if I was a bit of a cock-muncher down the studio.",Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Fine. It's totally fine, mate. Honestly. Listen, I might pop... just pop down the uh, Chinky. Do you want anything?",Living Room

2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Well, no.",Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, And obviously you don't think there's a global Jewish conspiracy controlling everything?,Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," What, you mean, am I a racist?",Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Yeah. If you think that and say those things, you're a racist, aren't you?",Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark, Well yeah.,Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," As it turns out, Daryl is a racist.",Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," You're sure he's a proper... you know, it wasn't just racist... horseplay?",Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," No, because I was in the tent with him for ages and we talked for a long time, and it was mostly on racial classifications, head measurements and so on.",Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark, Wow.,Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, I feel terrible. Do you think I should... confront him?,Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark, You mean you didn't confront him?,Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Yeah, no, naturally I confronted him, but maybe I should confront him again, more.",Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, Tell him I'm not here!,Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark, What? Why?,Living Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Because I didn't confront him, all right?",Living Room
2,2,Jeremy,Daryl,"Oh, hi, Daryl.",Flat

2,2,Jeremy,Daryl," He's not I'm afraid, he's gone out, to get a Thai curry.",Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Because that's what we eat nowadays while you're chomping on your racist carrots.,Flat
2,2,Mark,Sophie," Hope Jeff's neighbour got the cheque for the window. So sorry. What happened was we were passing and I said, ""Let's see if they're in, throw some stones at the window"" and Daryl thought I said ""a stone"" and the stone he picked was a brick and well he got the wrong window and you know the rest.",Restaurant
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Sorry I'm late, everyone. Hey, Mark, my man!",Restaurant

2,2,Johnson,Sophie," So, anyone see the game last night?",Restaurant
2,2,Sophie,Johnson," Uh, no.",Restaurant
2,2,Jeff,Johnson," I did. Thierry Henry, he made Savage look like a right carthorse didn't he?",Restaurant

2,2,Mark,Mark,"No no, not here. No, this can't happen!",Restaurant
2,2,Johnson,Daryl," ""You lot""?",Restaurant

2,2,Mark,Daryl," Listen, mate, while we've got a minute, the thing is I'm busy, you're busy, I just think maybe we should stop seeing each other so much.",Restaurant
2,2,Daryl,Mark," What, stop being mates?",Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Yeah, you know, you say potato, I say tomato - let's call the whole thing off.",Restaurant
2,2,Daryl,Mark," But, but why?",Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Well, it's the twenty-first century, no one actually likes each other any more, so let's just leave it at that shall we?",Restaurant
2,2,Daryl,Mark, No but I do like you! I think you're fucking great!,Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I don't have time. OK? There's no time. So let's just forget anything ever happened, OK?",Restaurant

2,2,Jeremy,Jeremy," Uh, Mark? I've got a massive, massive favour to ask you.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, Uh-huh?,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Yeah. It's, um... the thing is, Gog, he's got some reservations about the track and he's holding out on the four grand till we get it right.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, Uh-huh.,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," But the thing is, I've basically been very, very foolish, and I've spent all of our advance on drugs and shoes, and I really need to borrow quite a lot of money to go back into the studio and I was thinking I mean, you are the manager.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," OK, how much?",Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Brilliant! Now, the favour",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, That's not the favour?!,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Uh no. You see, the thing is, Gog he's really not very keen at all on any of the track except, as it turns out, for the cor anglais. He wants much, much more cor anglais.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," No, Jeremy. You know what Daryl's like.",Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," No, sure. Yeah. Absolutely. Of course. But look at it another way, we've all got our foibles. I mean, I, for example, hate mozzarella.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, It's not the same.,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," It is kind of the same. I mean, aren't we supposed to be living in a multicultural democracy? And isn't that the point? You know, the Jews and the Muslims and the racists all living happily together, side by side, doing and saying whatever the hell they like?",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Mark,"Cor anglais, of course. Probably plays it in the BNP jazz combo.",Recording Studio
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans," Brilliant, fantastic. What did you think, Hans?",Recording Studio

2,2,Mark,Mark,"I'm safe. In my cubicle, I'm safe.",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," So are we off for a pint, or what?",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Uh, Daryl, listen, the truth is I can't be associated with you any more, because you're a racist.",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," What? Yeah, but I thought we were on the same wavelength! You know, the sausage, the Euro, Clarkson.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl," There's a difference. Daryl, you can't hate people because of their ethnic background!",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Oh, right. Political correctness gone mad.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl," No! I hate political correctness gone mad more than anyone! I don't want to teach the world to sing, that would be horrible, but slavery? The Holocaust? That's just not on! Whereas, ""I Have A Dream"", South Africa, Benetton, it's- you've got to say, fair enough. Yeah?",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Yeah. OK, no. Fair enough. You've talked me round.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl, I have?,Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark, Fuck off! Thought police!,Recording Studio

2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Do we have to do this? We're not going to hurt him, are we?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," You want your money back, don't you? He's refusing to pay up, Mark. He's refusing to like the track.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, I told you you should've had a proper contract!,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans," How are you feeling, Super Hans?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy," Fine, totally fine.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Super Hans, You've kicked the crack?,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Mark," No, except now I bang a load of Valium up me arsehole for the comedown.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Super Hans, What's this?,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Mark, Cover. In case the cops turn up. Just a bunch of mates playing a lovely game of baseball.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy," Oh! Jeremy. Right, so, what, you've had more thoughts about the track?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," Yeah, yeah we have, actually.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy," OK, great.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog, Yeah. We thought we might smash your brains in with a baseball bat.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Gog, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," See, we want our money, and we're feeling a little bit clumsy. Whoops.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy,"Look, Jeremy, I've told you, it's out of my hands now. The Honda people are very hard to please.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," Oh, Honda, Honda, Honda. Fuck Honda.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Gog," Nice packet of Crunchy Nut you've got here. Pretty expensive, as I recall.",Gog's Flat

2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy," Oi, Jez!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Look, Jeremy, we can come back again, he's got the message.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Gog,"You're gonna pay, aren't you?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Mark, No.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," All right then, we've got our answer. Let's go!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy," We've got to hurt him on principle. Hit him with the fucking bat, Jez.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans, Why do I have to... why don't you do it? Punch him with the glove.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy, Punch him? I can't even make a fist!,Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," This is the whole point about contract law, the whole point of a contract is to make sure this kind of thing never happens!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog, Don't answer it.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy, What if it's Honda?,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog, It's not going to be Honda.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy, Could be Honda.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," All right, but a word out of place and you're getting the bat.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Others," Hello? Honda! Oh, really? Oh well, that's great news. I'm so pleased. Dave, call the police! There's people here, they're trying to kill me, they're trying to kill me!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Others," Hello uh, Dave, it's Mark here. I'm an old friend of Gog's. Don't worry, we're not trying to kill him, it's just he's never had sushi before, he thought we were trying to poison him! It's all right, Gog, you're not meant to cook it, it's supposed to be raw! Can he... can he call you back?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Sophie,Mark," Hey, Mark. What's the big stink?",JLB
2,2,Mark,Sophie, Daryl's getting the sack. Apparently he was a massive racist and not even his best friends knew. Someone reported him.,JLB

2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,†Other stuff?,Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"†Look, obviously God wanted us to enjoy ourselves. I mean, that's why he invented pills, and clubs, and lube and hardcore. But he also wanted us to give something back. And that's why he created the homeless, the lepers and the oil spills.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, suck up to God.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Nancy, listen. The only reason that I don't go to church is that, for me, everything's a church. This room is my church. The hall is my church. Cost Cutter's is a bloody cathedral.",Jez's Room

2,3,Jeremy,Mark,"†Come on, mate. There's no point torturing yourself.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Jeremy,"†It's not torture, it's research! Besides, I have a right to torture myself if I want to. What are you going to do? Call Amnesty? See? That! That's the push! She can't get away. He's some sort of animal. Did you see the push, Jeremy?",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Mark,"†Yeah, sure, that looked terrible.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy,"†Looks like a one-off, though, doesn't it? A crazy flash in the pan. Don't you think? I mean, Nancy, you're her friend. Give me your analysis. I mean, did she tell you what happened, after?",Living Room

2,3,Mark,Johnson,"†It's just a hunch, OK? And I always trust my hunches.",JLB
2,3,Jeff,Mark,"†Thanks, Columbo.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson,"†And, plus, Jeff doesn't have much experience. The 2003 Scottish Consumer Directive, for example.",JLB

2,3,Nancy,Mark,†So does God. It's called the Bible.,Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy,"†Oh, yes, the Bible. And I wonder what the Bible's view is on you doing it in the shower and the garden centre and up the bum. I mean, that's all right, is it, that's in the Bible? Or do you think maybe that's not in the Bible?",Living Room

2,3,Johnson,Mark,"†Sure. Sure you're not. That's what I told myself every day for fifteen years. But until you face your demons and put the plug in the jug, how can I trust you to be my main man in the office, let alone Frankfurt? Or Aberdeen?",JLB

2,4,April,MacLeish,†Yeah.,Dartmouth
2,4,Mark,MacLeish,†Sure.,Dartmouth
2,4,Mark,Mark,I'm being ushered into the inner ring. I knew there was an inner ring. I bet they make jokes about the Atkins diet and do prank calls to Gore Vidal in Esperanto!,Dartmouth
2,4,Student,Jeremy,"†So, what do you play in the bong?",Dartmouth Student Union

2,4,Jeremy,Pete,"†Oh, I can work with just the one, I've seen it done.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Pete,Jeremy,"†No, see Jez, we need a kind of front man, you know? Someone to hit a few keys on the sequencer, freak out, make a bit of a show. But would you feel weird about bumping Super Hans?",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Pete,"†No. I mean, yeah. But no, yes, initially, but, I've thought about it and, no I'd feel fine.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Pete,Jeremy,"†All right, wicked.",Dartmouth Student Union

2,4,Mark,Others,"†Mr Rashid don't be ridiculous, it's us remember? The El Dude brothers. You gave us that out-of-date hummus, Jez was really ill, and we laughed about it!",Mr Rashid's

2,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,I can't believe he called the police.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I've got to get out, I'm meant to be on stage any fucking minute!",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy,†What the hell were you thinking? Why didn't you just pay for it?,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark,"†They should be paying us to eat that crap Mark. Stealing things just makes everything very cheap. Plus, you know how I feel about capitalism.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy,"†Yes, confused.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark,"†Look Mark, I'm supposed to be on stage right now. I was wondering, maybe you could somehow, take the rap for me. We could say I was in your thrall. Like Hindley.",Mr Rashid's

2,4,Jeremy,Mark,"†Right, come on let's just do it!",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy,"†No Jeremy! There's procedures, forms, we need to go through the proper channels! All right, all right. Since you're so set on a life of crime, no pointing in adding criminal damage as well.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark,"†Woohoo. Great, cheer up mate. We're outlaws. Out on the lam. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy,†I'm gonna leave a tenner and a note.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Others,"†Look, I don't need to buy a ticket, I'm in the band. I'm not a punter. I got waylaid, there's been a mix-up. I don't belong here with the shit-munchers. Do I look like a civilian? You are gonna be so embarrassed in about five minutes.",Dartmouth Student Union

2,4,April,Mark,†See you after the lecture.,Dartmouth
2,4,Mark,April,"†Yeah, see you after the lecture.",Dartmouth
2,4,Mark,Mark,At least I never had to watch her recoil at my scrotal scar.,Dartmouth
2,4,Mark,Jeremy,"She would have done it. Given another night or two, she definitely would have.",Dartmouth
2,4,Jeremy,Mark,"†Yeah. So, another notch on the bedpost. Sort of.",Dartmouth
2,4,Mark,Mark,"This is OK, this is just a moment that will haunt me forever.",Dartmouth
2,5,Mark,Sophie,"†Hey! Soph, just heard the Shapeero Finance presentation's been cancelled. Rod Stamp's gone hyperglycaemic again.",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,†Oh dear! Poor Rod!,JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,"†Yeah, I know. Terrible. Still, on the bright side, free hour! Wanna come and see if marketing have left any biscuits in Meeting Room B?",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,"†Maybe. Although, I actually don't think it's such a good idea for us to hang out together.",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,†Oh?,JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,"†It's just, well, the thing is, Jeff's asked, said actually. He thinks you and I should see less of each other. He's sort of old fashioned that way.",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,"†Old fashioned? Right, what's next? Put you in a chastity belt and make you... drive around in an old fashioned car?",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,"†I'd really like to give it a go with Jeff. And, he's going to move in with me for a couple of months. See if that helps.",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,†Move in? That won't help! What about giving him some space? That might help!,JLB

2,5,Mark,Jeremy,Hello?,JLB
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,†When are you getting back from work?,Living Room
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†What? six-thirty just like normal. Look, you said it was urgent, Jeremy!",JLB
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,"†I thought we were supposed to be living together? Nancy doesn't get back from the States for two weeks. And Super Hans is back on the rig. I need a friend, Mark.",Living Room
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†Look Jez, just relax. Isn't Ready, Steady, Cook on?",JLB

2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†Look, there's some chocolate hidden in the fridge under the egg tray. See you tonight!",JLB
2,5,Mark,Mark,"OK, going undercover. Jeff's apparent mate, who couldn't possibly be trying to nick his bird from right under his stupid old fashioned nose. Mmm, OK, man-chat topics. Footballer Darren Anderton, figure of ridicule due to repeated injuries. Turkish shepherd, ate his own testicles. NB, ignore tragic earthquake context. Ferrari Testarossa, fast car. Obviously, no need to note that. Shit, I'm making too many notes! Just imbibe the culture. Um, yes. Civilisation is definitely doomed.",Mark's Room
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,†Hey. What's with all the mags?,Mark's Room

2,5,Mark,Jeremy,†This is a special mission.,Mark's Room

2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†Oh, Jez! Don't do that! Honestly, I won't be long. Then we can have a talk about stuff.",Mark's Room
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,†I don't wanna talk! I wanna live! I wanna do things!,Mark's Room
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,†What sort of things?,Mark's Room
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,"†I don't know! Fun things! Normal things! Archery, badger baiting. Whatever people do.",Mark's Room
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†I'll be as quick as I can and if you do do that thing, don't do it in here 'cause the hook's practically out of the door as it is.",Mark's Room
2,5,Jeff,Mark,"†So, what's with this sudden urge to join the pool league? I didn't even know you played.",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,"†Oh yeah, I play. I play all right. Misspent youth. You know the score.",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark,†Right.,Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,"†Plus, I thought it would be good to hang out a bit. 'Cause basically, you know, you're a bloke, I'm a bloke. We're both bloody good blokes. Unlike that idiotic Turkish shepherd who chewed off his own knackers. Did you see that?",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark,"†Er, no, I don't think so.",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,†Bloody shithead. Yes! Mark the Shark is in business!,Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark,"†You're stripes, Mark.",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,"†Oh, yes, right. You play that, do you? Of course. So, FHM have only gone and done a bloody sex issue. Did you see that? Loads of birds, foil bag, the whole caboodle. Carmen Electra's in there. I would seriously love to really, really bang her. Although, if it was a choice between that and a drive in a Ferrari Testarossa, phew! Too close to call, yeah?",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark,"†So you've give up trying to hump Soph then, have you?",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,†Pardon?,Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark,†I said you've given up trying to-,Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,"†Yes, I heard what you said. Well, let's be honest. I suppose the best man won.",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark,†Right.,Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,"†This is fun, isn't it?",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,"†Hey, Marky Mark!",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†Hey, Jez.",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,"†Brilliant! Thanks for the call. You see? This is better than just sitting at home in the same old trousers, isn't it?",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†Actually, that's Jeff's.",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,†Jeff's?,Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†He's in the bog. But, the thing is, it's currently going a bit terribly, but it's really important that I make friends with him. So, I thought, you're more of a fun sort of guy than me.",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,"†What, so I'm the fluffer? Is that it?",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†No, it's not like that. Look, if I don't make friends with Jeff, there's a very good chance I'll never speak to Sophie probably ever again.",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,Oh! Hi Jeff! You remember Jeremy.,Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Jeff,"†Oh, nice to see you, mate. Yeah, how's it going? Oh, fantastic trainers!",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Jeremy,"†Cheers, mate!",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Jeff,"†I've got a pair like that. The straps go all the way up your leg like a Roman sandal. Wicked, aren't they?",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,"†So, what now? Round of Sambucas and hit a club or just head back to ours, or... Sophie's?",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark,"†Oh, well, actually, I just had a call from a mate. He's got a poker school about to start over at his place. If you're interested in losing a bit of money, we could always manage a fresh face.",Pool Hall

2,5,Mark,Jeff,"†Right, sorry.",Jeff's Mate's House
2,5,Mark,Mark,I think I've got a pretty good hand. But there's always a chance someone else might have a better one. There's just no way of knowing for sure.,Jeff's Mate's House
2,5,Mark,Jeff,I fold.,Jeff's Mate's House

2,5,Mark,Jeff,†What a night! Looks like we're gonna be a great bunch of mates! We could all pile back to yours and Sophie's?,Jeff's Mate's House
2,5,Jeff,Mark,"†Bit late for you, isn't it, mate?",Jeff's Mate's House
2,5,Jeff,Jeremy,So what is it you normally play? Is it Seven Card Stud? Texas Hold 'Em?,Jeff's Mate's House
2,5,Jeremy,Jeff,"†I just play the cards as they're dealt with, my friend.",Jeff's Mate's House
2,5,Jeff,Jeremy,†Yeah.,Jeff's Mate's House

2,5,Mark,Sophie,"Hey, Soph.",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,"†Oh, hey Mark.",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,"†You know, I was just talking to Alan about Rod from Shapeero Finance. Don't you think we should really do something for him?",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,†Yeah.,JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,"†Yeah, for diabetes. Give something back to a top JLB client and give a nasty, un-glamorous illness a kick in the pants at the same time. I said I'd talk to you about a sponsored something.",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,"†Right. Sure, we could do that but-",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,"†It's fine if you don't want to. I mean, it is for charity, but I could just tell Alan you're not into it.",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark,"†No! Um, sure. Yeah, of course we can do a sponsored something. I could a sponsored run. Er, you could do a sponsored history... thing. Or a dig? Or just reading?",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie,"†Could do. Although, if we do something together, it's more likely to capture people's imagination, yeah? I was thinking maybe",JLB
2,5,Mark,Mark,"maximum physical contact, potential horseplay",JLB

2,5,Mark,Jeremy,"†Oh, right. Sorry, mate. I appreciate what you're doing, but the Jeff project's been abandoned.",JLB
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,"†Oh, yeah. No, he just called me up and asked if I fancy going kickboxing with him. And I thought, why the hell not?",JLB
2,5,Mark,Jeremy,†You're going out with him for fun?,JLB
2,5,Jeremy,Mark,†That's right! Jeff's a really good guy! And he doesn't complain that the music's too loud in bars and he doesn't go all weird when it's his round and you ask him for an extra bag of nuts! He's a real man.,JLB

2,6,Jeremy,Nancy,†Oh.,Kitchen

2,6,Jeremy,Nancy,†But I thought you thought it was just a stupid piece of paper.,Kitchen

3,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Perfect? Super Hans, it doesn't even look like a pub.",The Mitre

3,2,Jeremy,Mark,It's worth a try. It's not gonna work. Doesn't work.,Flat
3,2,Mark,Others,"OK, OK, I guess we've just got to bloody take responsibility, haven't we? Hello? NHS Direct? Hi, listen, I wanna get my friend sectioned. Yes, but I don't know what the procedure is. How easy would that be to do, a sectioning? I mean, would I have to be involved at all or could I just give you the house number and assure you that she is completely mental?",Flat
3,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"If it turns out to be easy, I could get a few other troublesome people sectioned. Get Mark sectioned, get his nice, big room. Guess it might cause a bit of a bump in the friendship, but I mean, we got over the coffee rings on the dining table incident, eventually.",Flat
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,They're putting me through somewhere.,Flat

3,2,Mark,Sophie,"Seriously, it's fine not calling back. Hope it's not 'cause I hung up in the middle of our, you know, thing. But really do please call me back. All my warmest wishes, Mark. Ridiculous sign-off, not sending her a birthday card.",Living Room

3,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah. So listen, I've been busting a gut trying to sort the pub. I tried to get European Bob on board, but he's a jerk-off. He's still stuck in the crisp age. I mean, what next, bloody mead on tap?",Living Room

3,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"So, what do you think, the old team back together?",Living Room
3,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Well, maybe, but we need to agree on some stuff, like, and don't fly off the handle, but I'm just really not happy with the name ""Free the Paedos"". I mean, can't we call it something more normal, like ""The Swan and... Tomato""?",Living Room
3,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah, or compromise. ""Swan and Paedo"".",Living Room
3,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,Yeah. OK. sure. And what about lager and-,Living Room

3,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Merry's been sectioned? You're kidding! Jesus, who's gonna be next?",Living Room
3,2,Mark,Mark,"Incredible, still no call from Soph. If she's broken up with me, maybe I suppose I could consider Merry. Would sort of suit me to have a girlfriend in an institution, regulated meeting times. I might get to have a say in her medication. I'd like to be able to chemically alter my girlfriend's moods.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"Well, I have to say she's looking a lot better.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Doctor,"Well, we'll just grab her stuff and get her out your hair.",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Super Hans,"No, no. I'm afraid Merry needs to be kept a close eye on just now.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"But she's fine! She's always been the life and soul! Tabasco in your pint, Frisbee in the kitchen, that's Merry. She's kooky.",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Jeremy,She's in the acute stage of a manic episode.,Hospital

3,2,Merry,Jeremy,I just want... everything's too much right now.,Hospital

3,2,Mark,Mark,At least she isn't proposing sexual intercourse any more.,Hospital
3,2,Merry,Mark,"Mark, can you give these to Jeremy? They're kind of important.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Mark,Probably stopped fancying me now the sedatives have kicked in and she's lost the beer goggles. Normal service has been resumed.,Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"Come on, mate, let her go, it's for the best.",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Jeremy,"Look, it might take us a month or so just to see what kind of drug or cognitive therapies might help Merry with her condition.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"Oh right, I see. Your little world is threatened by all the amazing Jack Nicholsons and Robin Williamses burning so bright you've gotta keep them down with your chemical cosh.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Doctor,"Yeah come on man, set her free. All she needs is a vodka and tonic and a nice little lie down.",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Super Hans,"I'm sorry, but there's no way I can sign her out. She's not well.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"Your dream is just everyone on the omnibus, grey, eating grey sludge. That's your dream, isn't it?",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Jeremy,No.,Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Doctor,"We'll look after her. She's just wacky, you know? She's basically fine.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Super Hans,"She's not fine, she's temporarily mad.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, you're with them now, are you Mark? Well tell me, is it mad to be diagnosed with a mental disorder, or is it in fact, much more mad to get up every morning to go to your boring job so you can print out lots of meaningless documents?",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Doctor,"I'm sorry about this, it's the 60s. He thinks he's living in the 60s.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Doctor,"How about this? You let her go, and we promise, promise to keep her restrained, tightly tied.",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Super Hans,"Look, I appreciate how passionately you feel about your friend, but there's no way I can sign her out. I'm sorry.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, Merry wanted me to give you these deeds. I'm not sure why or what-",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"OK, well, fair enough, mate. I've said my piece, but you win. After all, you're the expert. OK, guys, let's go.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"So, Jez, what- why is she giving you these?",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Uh, those, I don't know, they're not important. Just give them to me, really.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"What? The deeds to the pub? Of course they're important. In fact, why do you even need them?",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, yeah, didn't I, didn't I tell you? Yeah, um, she's giving us the place. So just hand them over, really.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,She gave it to you?,Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, yeah. I mean, it's all perfectly legal, probably, Mark. I don't really see what you're worried about.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"But that's... obviously, I mean, she's not in her right mind.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Mark,She was fine when she gave us the pub.,Hospital
3,2,Mark,Super Hans,"Well, are you sure, 'cause I guess giving away a pub that's worth several thousands of pounds for free, that kind of suggests you haven't exactly got your best thinking cap on.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, we're not exploiting her. Once we turn the pub into a cash cow, we'll give her some of the cream.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah, right.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I just think, in this situation, Merry needs an impartial adviser like me to help her decide what's best.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"God, you're loving this, aren't you? Holding the deeds like Mr. Monopoly with his top hat and his iron. Do you really think if you don't give us her pub, she's gonna let you screw her?",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Mark,Ha ha.,Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh God, that is low. That is really nuts.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,Are you saying I'm mad? Is that what you're saying? Are you gonna try and get me sectioned for simply following my dream?,Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I just think the best thing is if I hand these to the authorities here and let them decide.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Doctor,"Hi there, Doctor. Listen, I just wondered if you could take care of-",Hospital

3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, tell him.",Hospital

3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy! Are you...? Look, if there's anyone who's going nuts here, it's not me, it's you! They could section you for trying to section me!",Hospital

3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Easy money. Turns out getting a job doesn't involve spending hours and hours making sure every single word on your CV is spelt right, eh Mark?",Kitchen
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Nothing means anything to you does it? Friendship. Loyalty. They're just fusty old words like ""sixpence"" and ""codpiece"" to you aren't they?",Kitchen

3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, well, there's not much I can really do about that, is there? Unless you want me to buy her, like, the biggest puppy or heart-shaped cushion in the world. Is that literally what you want me to do? Buy her a puppy the size of Digby, the biggest dog in the world?",Kitchen
3,4,Mark,Mark,"If I don't pay it's OK. If I don't pay it's OK. Oh God. Four hours of my precious holiday wasted. Face it, the day's a write-off. Might as well just carry on. Must be something to puncture my thickening shield of numbness.",Mark's Room

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Thanks, and you're back from work. How is work?",Kitchen

3,4,Jeremy,Mark,I don't care. I'm just interested.,Kitchen

Of course, there had to be a sport for me. I just never realised. I'm a natural jogger. Feel the legs like two great steam locomotives pumping away. I'm Cram, I'm Ovett, I'm unstoppable. I'm- Jesus, is that a stitch? I- fuck, I think I'm gonna be sick. I've gotta... slow. I need to... walk. Oh, I think I'm gonna puke. I'm literally gonna die. What an idiotic boob I was about ten or eleven seconds ago.",Park

Yeah, well, while you're failing to get anywhere at all with my ex, Mark, I'm doing the nasty with your very own sister. Not really in the moment though. What's wrong? Got my sex mix on. Is it? She can't. Does she? God, she does, she smells like Mark. She must use the same talcum powder. Who still uses talcum powder? Bollocks. Gotta get into this.",Jeremy's Room

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,Steady on. My mushroom stroganoff isn't that bad.,Kitchen
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, look, I know you're gonna say no to this but I said I'd ask. Sarah's looking for a place to stay for the next few months and I said probably not because it's a small flat and that's your view, and there'd be bathroom issues.",Kitchen
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, no, I'm sure we can work it out. It would be a shame to break up the lovebirds. Unless, I mean, you do want her to stay don't you?",Kitchen
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, yeah, of course. I mean obviously, Mark, that's obvious. I'd be very, very happy.",Kitchen
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Then you're just gonna have to take responsibility for your actions, for once.",Kitchen
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,Why should I have to take responsibility for my actions? I just do my actions. It's not like I spend hours and hours thinking about them. What kind of life would that be?,Kitchen

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, well, even if it is family stuff, frankly I don't wanna know about all the infidelities and heartache. And, you know, if Uncle Lance was touched up by the vicar and that's why he's such a tit at Christmas. Well, I'm sorry but I just don't wanna hear about it.",Living Room
3,4,Big Suze,Jeremy,She does sound very upset.,Living Room

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh come on Jez, this is me you're talking to. There's no need to pretend.",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No need to pretend? Well, maybe it's time you stopped pretending not to be in love with Big Suze.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"What? What do you? Look, Jez, all right. The fact is she is a beautiful woman. That's just a fact. A blind man could see that. But, I mean, I'm not gonna do anything. I'm just like a kind of blind eunuch looking at a painting.",Flat

3,4,Sarah,Mark,Mark what's- where's Jez?,Flat
3,4,Mark,Sarah,"Oh Sarah, I... Blimey. Look, the thing is... Look, it's really not my responsibility to tell you this. Jeremy's gone, all right? He's pissed off. He's left. And I'm not gonna do his dirty work.",Flat

3,4,Sarah,Mark,He's dumping me?,Flat

3,4,Mark,Mark,"Great. OK, so I've dumped my sister. That's great. That feels good. I'm intrigued to see what I'm gonna do next. Maybe I'll ring up Granddad and tell him I think he's a boring twat.",Flat

3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh all right. What should I be having? Gentleman's relish with olives? Anyway, Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes are just Frosties for wankers.",Kitchen

3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Anything from Soph?,Kitchen

3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Have you told her you love her?,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Are you kidding? That's like firing first in a duel. If you miss, you're fucked.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, no, mate, Saying I love you puts you in the driving seat. Sometimes I tell them I love them early on on a first date, just to get things off to a good start.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Doesn't that devalue it a bit?,Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,No. Maybe. A bit. Who cares? It works.,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Aren't you going to open your post?,Kitchen

3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, That one's On Her Majesty's Service, for God's sake.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, sure, it's On Her Majesty's Service, delivered by the Royal Mail. Probably an invitation to one of Princess Anne's shepherds pie and dogging parties. See? Now they want me to do jury service.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Jury service? You've been called up for jury service? I can't believe they'd choose you! Must be some kind of mistake.,Kitchen

3,5,Jeremy,Mark,It's a complicated film.,Kitchen

3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Anyway, I'd probably find jury service pretty simple. Because whatever it is, I'll just let them off.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, Don't try and upset me.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's probably some young black kid whose been accused of stealing a bun, and I'm gonna set him free.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Don't you think you should wait till you hear the details?,Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,That's what they want you to do - hear the details and confuse you. I'm definitely gonna acquit.,Kitchen
3,5,Johnson,Mark,"So listen up guys. I'm looking to shake up the department, and I want you two to be my enforcers. Mm? My Cheech and Chong. My Skinner and Baddiel. You'll be the iron fists inside my velvet glove. The spiky balls on the end of my stick. Yeah?",JLB
3,5,Mark,Johnson,"Nice, yes.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Jeff,"Now remind me, which one of you two is balling Sophie right now?",JLB
3,5,Jeff,Johnson,"Ah, he is. Well, theoretically.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Mark,Patrick tells me she's not getting on all that well in Bristol.,JLB
3,5,Mark,Johnson,Really?,JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"If she gets fired and everything goes wrong, I'll be there to pick up the pieces.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Mark,"She's been slacking off. Coming in late. Apparently, she called Colin Cooper a dickhead.",JLB
3,5,Jeff,Johnson,"Well, he is a dickhead.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Mark,"Yeah well the point is someone's gotta talk to her. Mark, maybe you could have a word? Get her to clean up her act? Unofficial verbal warning. Is that cool?",JLB
3,5,Mark,Johnson,"Oh, OK, sure.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Bollocks. Could be a difficult call. It might be good. Tell her I love her, then before it gets too soppy, hit her with the disciplinary matters.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez! So, first day in court, tell me everything.",Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, I've taken a solemn oath. I know that doesn't mean a lot to you but I take it quite seriously.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I could get us a fried chicken bucket for dinner. And from a properly franchised outlet, not the one that gave you that fever.",Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's credit card fraud, and it's a woman. Six counts, four in the Nescliffe area, two in Cosford.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Credit card fraud?! Nescliffe?! A woman?! Oh, my God, this is incredible!",Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, sure, it sounds incredible for the first three hours. God, it's boring. ""Are you guilty?"", ""Blah, blah, blah."" I mean It's a joke, she's obviously guilty.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Why? Has she taken the stand? What's her alibi?,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She's the guilty type, she looks shifty.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Shifty?,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah you know the type. Dressed up all nice for court but wouldn't look out of place with a can of strong lager and an incredibly cheap fag in her mouth.,Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,I thought you were going to acquit.,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She's white. Plus I was talking to another jury bloke and he thinks the same. I think we're all thinking the same basically you know, there's no smoke without fire.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,No smoke without fire?! Is that what a thousand years of the English judicial system comes down to? No smoke without fire?!,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, relax She's going down. And if she didn't do it, so what? She's the type, she'd probably just do something else.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Ah, soup. Lovely hug in a mug. All I need now is a kiss in a tube. A wank in a packet. Better call Sophie. Or maybe, just before, play solitaire for three or four hours.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Shit, it's her!",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Hello, Sophie?",JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Hi, Mark! Listen, good news. I'm coming down tonight.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,Are you?,JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Yeah! Can we hang out tonight? I miss you.,JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Of course, I- I miss you too. Although, tonight, you do know it's Thursday?",JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Oh yeah, I'll just pull a sickie in the morning.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, OK.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Johnson's right, she's dangerously out of control.",JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"So, I'll come over to yours about seven-ish? Ooh this is going to be great!",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,Brilliant. Bye.,JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,Shit. Bottled it. Tell her tonight after chicken and wine and Sara Lee. Maybe I could get some chocolate-flavour condoms. I might be more relaxed if we both regarded my penis as a novelty item.,JLB
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh the jury is so boring. Why couldn't I get something interesting, like a cat-strangling, or a murder case that goes right to the heart of government? Oh, my God it's her. The defendant.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Do I know you? God, you're on the jury, aren't you?",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Yeah. Yeah, I am a bit. Sorry.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Wow, this is weird.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Yup! I probably shouldn't...,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Well I shouldn't, probably.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"To be honest, it's nice to get away from the jury. They're so boring. All they want to talk about is the case.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Yeah? What they saying about it then?,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,Shit.,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Oh, just uh... we all think you're innocent.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Really? That's wicked!,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,Just sugar the pill a bit.,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"I know I probably shouldn't do this but, what's your name?",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Jeremy.,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Pleased to meet you. I'm Carla. Tell you what though, I'll be glad when this is all over. Those wooden chairs are killing my back.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Oh God, tell me about it. That's why I sit in the corner, because you can sort of lean against the wall, and then if it gets a bit boring you can- you know, it's just better.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"What about that judge, though, eh?",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Oh God, yeah. He's so judgmental. ""I rule this, I rule that"".",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Eh that would be a good name for him. Judge Mental! Hey, I tell you what, I plead guilty to wanting a mochaccino!",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Objection!,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Overruled!,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This isn't wrong, just illegal. Like drink-driving.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Foreman,Jurors,You'd have thought she could've come up with a better alibi than that.,Juror's Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh I'm the foreman, I'm the foreman. Only I get to talk to the judge. Fuck you.",Juror's Room
3,5,Foreman,Jurors,So should we take a vote?' All those who think she's guilty raise a hand.,Juror's Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"They can't send her down, they don't know her. I don't know her. But I do fancy her.",Juror's Room
3,5,Jeremy,Foreman,"Er, yeah, I just don't think she is that guilty. I mean I think there is a reasonable doubt.",Juror's Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,I'm in Twelve Angry Men. I'm the only one who's not angry. I'm horny. That's much nicer.,Juror's Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh what a night. We'll eat and laugh and I'll make out I think Colin Cooper's a dickhead too, when actually he's doing bloody good work with a difficult team and some very testing targets.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Haha! Haha haha. Hurhurhurhur.,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,What's funny?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, nothing. Doesn't matter.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Is it something to do with the case?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Er, yeah, it is, kind of.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah. What's going on?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's really... honestly, it's nothing.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Did the uncle show up? They haven't found the missing security tapes from Ryman's?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, no, it's nothing like that. Anyway that doesn't matter any more because she's definitely innocent.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Is she? Why, what came out? What happened?",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, Nothing came out, it's just I got to know her a bit and it's obvious she wouldn't do something like that.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,You got to know her a bit?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. We bumped into each other, we've been texting, we're going to go out for a drink.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"For God's sake Jeremy, you're not supposed to speak to the defendant, it's against the law.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,The only seat in the cafe was next to her. What was I supposed to do? Blank her? That's against the law. The law of social niceness.,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you've got to break this off. You've got to tell her to stop texting you and that you can't meet up for a drink.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, so suddenly I can't go out drinking with the defendant. Well why not?",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, I suppose people might think it would make you less impartial if you're trying to bone the woman you're meant to judging.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh that is typical. ""Jeremy can't be trusted to judge the woman he's sleeping with but... but Tony Blair can."" Yeah?",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Jez. it's contempt of court.,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Look Mark, I'm a musician in case you'd forgotten. Yeah? I answer to a higher law, the law of, ""If it feels good, do it.""",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, that's a great law isn't it! What's that, Gaddafi's law?",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's the musicians' law. Colonel Gaddafi could not lay down a bass hook, Mark. That should be clear even to you. God!",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,Sophie! The Sophster! Sophistry!,Living Room

3,5,Dom,Mark,"Oh, sorry, that's me. Sorry, I'm really gonna have to take this.",Flat
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Isn't he fab?!,Flat
3,5,Mark,Mark,"He's gay! He's obviously gay. My God, I actually have gaydar. Is he going? I hope he's going. Shutting the door might be a bit aggressive if he's not.",Flat
3,5,Sophie,Mark,So how are you?,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, good, thanks. You look great.",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Thanks! Do you like my hair? Shaylee did it, she works in the juice bar with Dom. And she does Indian head massage too. God, it's orgasmic!",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,Juice bar? Massage? Orgasm?! That's everything I stand against!,Living Room
3,5,Dom,Sophie,"Hey, that was Olly. He's with Jude and beautiful Laura. They want to meet up for cocktails at the Lava Lounge. What do you think?",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Ooh I don't know, Mark? Oh you'd love Olly, he's such a great laugh.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Er, well, that sounds great, it's just I've made chicken, I've got wine. I've got DVDs. Ocean's Twelve and Meet The Fockers.",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Right er, we did see those at the cinema.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah well It's sort of like a reminiscipackage. Plus there's commentaries, outtakes... bloopers.",Living Room
3,5,Dom,Sophie,"Ooh, just come for one cocktail. Olly freaked out when I told him you were here. Oh, come on, he loves you, Soph. He'll literally puke if you don't come.",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"What do you think, Mark? It'd be fun.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Er, well, I guess I'd hate to be responsible for someone actually throwing up, so yeah, great.",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Waheyyy!,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,"You win this one, Sophie, but I will have my revenge. All day at the National Maritime Museum.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,"One cocktail. That was the arrangement. One cocktail, then home. Not four cocktails and off to a gay club.",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Oh Carla says she's sorry she couldn't make it for a drink but she'll meet us here instead.,Club
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Great. Trapped all night with the homos and the criminals. Like prison, but without even the privacy of my own cell.",Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Oh Mark, if the bouncer asks, just say you're gay.",Club
3,5,Mark,Sophie,What?!,Club
3,5,Others,Mark,"You been here before, mate? You gay, pal?",Club
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Lie. Say yes, say yes.",Club
3,5,Mark,Others,"No. No, I'm not. God, sorry. I mean I did once have this thing with a- I had these feelings, but it was complicated. It was more a sort of atmosphere, nothing ever really- I mean sexuality's a sort of a spectrum isn't it, rather than a black and-",Club
3,5,Others,Mark,Go on. Fuck off. In you go.,Club
3,5,Mark,Others,"Thanks, great. There are a lot of gay guys in there tonight? Great. Brilliant.",Club
3,5,Mark,Mark,"God, how did I end up here? And will I ever be allowed to leave? Just got to ride the waves of alienation and self-loathing.",Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Are you having a good time?,Club
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, yeah, wicked.",Club
3,5,Dom,Jeremy,So how did you guys meet?,Club
3,5,Jeremy,Dom,"Oh, that's quite funny, actually.",Club
3,5,Carla,Dom,It was at a trial.,Club
3,5,Sophie,Carla,"Oh right, are you a lawyer?",Club
3,5,Carla,Sophie,As a matter of fact I'm the defendant.,Club
3,5,Jeremy,Sophie,And I'm on the jury!,Club
3,5,Carla,Sophie,"And the funniest part is, the trial isn't even over yet!",Club
3,5,Dom,Carla,"Oh, my God!",Club
3,5,Sophie,Carla,That is so weird!,Club
3,5,Mark,Mark,And apparently I'm just a stick in the mud for thinking their breaking the law is anything other than one of those brilliant urban jokes.,Club
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, if I need the bog, this place, its official classification is ""gay-friendly"" yeah?",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yep, gay, gay-friendly.",Club
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Does that mean friendly gays, or friendly to the gays? 'Cause, to be honest, friendly gays sound not worse, but, you know...",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh Mark, what? You think you're irresistible?!",Club
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,People... men have looked at me.,Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, well just don't go over into that corner 'cause that's where the guys who like straight acting, tubby homophobes hang out.",Club
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Another drink, everybody?",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Is erm...? That isn't... is that your name?,Club
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, it's a second marriage. A bit complicated.",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Oh, right. The old magic card.",Club
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Well, you might think that, but I couldn't possibly comment.",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God she's amazing. She sees something she wants and she takes it. None of the ""Is this mine or is it someone else's?"" crap. She probably has men queuing up.",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"You know what, Carla? I think I love you.",Club
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,You what? But you hardly know me.,Club
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,So what? I'm a musician. I think on my feet. I speak with my heart.,Club
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yep, Jailhouse Rock.",Club
3,5,Olly,Sophie,I've got four brown bears and a couple of Foghorn Leghorns.,Club

3,5,Mark,Sophie,Er well I'm not really sure I'd-,Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Look I know it's not really your kind of thing, but that's what I thought before I did it and it's really good fun. I've done it a few times now, it's great.",Club
3,5,Mark,Sophie,Is there not even a slim chance that I might die?,Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Mark, I had an amazing time, you'll love it. I want you to love it. It'll be a special night.",Club
3,5,Mark,Sophie,Yes. Of course. Sure.,Club
3,5,Olly,Mark,"Take a Foghorn. They've got a nice, floaty launch with a soft, crunchy landing.",Club
3,5,Mark,Mark,"So a candle stuck in a wine bottle apparently doesn't cut it any more. Now for a special night, you have to have class A drugs and... fisting.",Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Mark, I'm so proud of you!",Club
3,5,Mark,Mark,"She's proud of me? For taking a little white pill of drugs? But probably if I'd fought at Goose Green, she wouldn't want to know.",Club
3,5,Dom,Sophie,We are gonna have such an amazing night.,Club
3,5,Mark,Mark,You are gonna have an amazing night. I am going to have a perfectly ordinary night. Right under your stupid nose.,Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Who'd have thought it ey? You and me out clubbing, you off your tits. I can genuinely see us eventually reminiscing about this.",Club
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Right yeah Jez, listen, the thing is, I didn't actually pop my pill. I'm pretending. In fact mate, I could do with a few pointers on how to be a druggie.",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh Mark, why didn't you bang one?",Club
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Because I don't want to wake up dribbling in a phone box with a trucker's penis in my ear!,Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Mark that is so not the E experience. You're much more likely to wake up with depression and a sense of worthlessness.,Club
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"But tonight, all that crap you talk when you're off your noggin, I never really listen. What do you prattle on about? And how should I say I'm feeling?",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, look. Like, when you're coming up, it's kind of... Yeah? And then you're just- I mean, everything you do is just kind of... Yeah. And then when you're going down, you sort of just talk about how we're all the same but there are these systems that keep us apart and stuff.",Club
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, thanks.",Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Hey, Mark. How are you doing? Are you feeling it yet?",Club
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling...",Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Really? Shall I get you some water?,Club

3,5,Mark,Sophie,"And, and do you know what, I also think I might be getting the famous munchies.",Club
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Really? On an E? I'll get you some water.,Club
3,5,Olly,Mark,"I tell you what, me and you, we've got a connection, haven't we? Can you feel it. We're on the same wavelength, yeah?",Club

3,5,Mark,Olly,"Yep, yeah I can still feel it.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, I'm so tired. How did my house become a rave? This is probably how a squat starts. They'll never leave, and eventually they'll brick me up in my room and ownership will pass to them because a high court judge will rule me to be officially ""not living life to the max.""",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Soph, it's lovely, your incessant rubbing of my back, but it is starting to chafe.",Living Room

3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Do you think I should go and get me stuff out from...,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"What? She wants to talk normally after what we just did? I mean, I like edgy sex, but where was the humanity?",Living Room
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Hey! Check out the easy pickings.,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Yeah? Don't you think..,Living Room

3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Don't worry about him, he's probably a banker on 300K.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Yeah I think he actually works in a juice bar.,Living Room
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Whatever.,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"So, about the case. Um, just between us, the credit cards, that was you, was it?",Living Room
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"No, Jez. That's the funny thing. I wasn't even around for those. I was in Lincoln raking in a bit on a housing benefit scam.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Brilliant. Ooh, nasty scar.",Living Room
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Yeah. Bit of a bitch fight one night in Sunderland. Still, you want to see the other girl, 'cause she can't see you eh, not now!",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Brilliant.,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, fuck. This is getting a bit too real. Just keep kissing. If we're kissing, she can't say scary stuff.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Look at these drop-outs. They think they're having fun. If we were agricultural workers, the day would already be half gone.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Are you all right, Soph?",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"I don't know. The room's going a bit spinny, and a think I might, erm... I burped some sick. Can you get me out of here, Mark?",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"OK. OK. What you need is some peace and quiet, and some rest. And a cup of tea and some toast with peanut butter.",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Oh that sounds nice.,Living Room
3,5,Olly,Sophie,"Hey Soph, where you going? We're going to have a spliff. Say hello to my little friend hehehe.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Olly,She's going to bed. She doesn't want any more of your drugs.,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"You just have a nice lie-down there Soph. I'll bring the tea and toast through in a minute, OK?",Mark's Room
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Listen, do you wanna...",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Again? Already?,Living Room
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Yeah. I'm in the mood for celebrating. Another few hours, and I'm going to be free as a bird.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, no. She's going to go free and come and live here, and we'll have to do horrible sex and go carjacking together.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Olly,"Right, OK that's it, turn the music down. You can stop smoking your drugs. I'm making tea and toast for Sophie. I'm putting on Radio 4. Everything's normal. I'm not really high on drugs, so you can stop talking your nonsense on my time.",Living Room
3,5,Olly,Mark,"Whoa, what's the problem, man? Can't we just chill?",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Olly,"No, you can't. You've been chilling long enough. This is reality calling.",Living Room
3,5,Olly,Mark,But what about you and me? The bond?,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Olly,"There is no bond. You're not a bad person, but I'm afraid to say you are a moron. Now pull your socks up and get your shoes on. Come on, all of you.",Living Room
3,5,Olly,Mark,"Oh, man!",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Olly,"Listen, while we're at it, there are systems for a reason in this world. Economic stability, interest rates, growth. It's not all a conspiracy to keep you in little boxes. All right? It's only the miracle of consumer capitalism that means you're not lying in your own shit, dying at forty-three with rotten teeth, and a little pill with a chicken on it is not going to change that. Now come on. Fuck off!",Living Room

3,5,Jeremy,Foreman,Why bother? We're never going to agree. She's going to get off.,Juror's Room
3,5,Foreman,Jeremy,"Well, no, actually, because the judge has ruled he'll accept a majority verdict. So if just a couple of your lot will consider joining us, then we can convict.",Juror's Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit. Could I do this? She is technically innocent. But, really, she's totally guilty. Plus, women's prison, it's probably like one long hen night.",Juror's Room
3,5,Jeremy,Foreman,"Well, actually, I was thinking, I've had quite a big think about everything and, um, I think I've changed my mind.",Juror's Room
3,5,Jurors,Jeremy,Why? The security footage?,Juror's Room

3,5,Jeremy,Foreman,"OK, sure. If you want. Say it's a mistrial, go crying to Daddy. But look, maybe I didn't play by the rules this time. Maybe I am a bit of a maverick, but I think I've got this case pretty much solved. And, yes, I can apologise for how I've done that, but I could never apologise for telling the truth. And the truth is that this woman is evil! And if we let her go today, we are going to be responsible for whatever she does, so help me God, and let the Lord be my witness!",Juror's Room

3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Why?,Pub
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well not because the hotel mega deal vouchers from the Sunday Times expire at the end of the month, that doesn't enter into it.

3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, you love rationing, don't you? You've been waiting for an opportunity to do rationing on me since the day we met and finally, finally, one's coming along and you love it, don't you?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,I just thought a block each every two hours and-,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Bollocks, give me my half now. You can ration yourself if you're so keen on it.",Quantocks

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, I explained to you all that.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh come on Mark, you knew what would happen as soon as you mentioned chocolate you knew I'd want to eat it. You know my nature. This isn't fair, you're using my nature against me.",Quantocks

3,6,Mark,Mark,Always got the Twix. No need to mention the Twix.,Quantocks

3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So listen mate, about this whole, um, you asking Sophie to get married.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah?,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I mean, it's brilliant and everything, but, I was just wondering, have you considered, like, not doing it?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Not doing it? But that's what this whole weekend's been about. I saved for three months for the mega deal vouchers.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No obviously and after all that... clipping, you're gonna want to have something to show for it. Like a wife. But, is it really a good idea?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know, I kind of assumed it was because I spend all my time thinking about it, I'm obsessed with it.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Ah yeah. But you see, Super Hans is obsessed with crack and poppers and dusting his knob with speed but it doesn't make it right, does it? I mean, what is it about her that you actually love?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Are you kidding? Everything. Her, you know... I mean, she has changed a bit lately but we were... we had this connection.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Right.,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Which admittedly is kind of going, but... you know, she's funny. Although now I wonder whether she really was funny or whether she was just being normal but I liked her so much I thought she was funny.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah, I know that one.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Plus, when I was at the height of Sophie madness it was when watching her across a hot photocopier... the little looks... the funny doodles.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Before you really had a relationship?,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly. It's almost like... the more we've got to know each other, the worse it's been. I mean we really have almost nothing in common.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Well maybe that's a sign?,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh my God. I- I don't have to marry her. Jez, I'm not going to ask her to marry me. There might even be other women in the country who are willing to speak to me and now I can go out and find them. Or just give up on women and eat toasted sandwiches and watch TV.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh don't give up on women mate. I mean there's she-males, hookers, Thai brides, all God's rich tapestry.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Brilliant! Wow, I feel good. Hey, isn't this-? Jez, this is a footpath! A genuine, National Trust-maintained public right of way!",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Great, fantastic. Well let's go down shall we? We can snaffle the rest of the choco, go fifty-fifty.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez where you going, you great doofus? It's this way.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Err no, this way, down, yeah? Down the mountain, remember?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, look, Jez we went down and then up, look I've just got this really, really strong feeling that I'm right and you should probably just give in because we both know that I'm a lot more stubborn than you, so just give in now.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, normally I give in but today I'm right and I don't want to go back up the mountain.",Quantocks

3,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"And that's definitely your settled decision as a grown-up man, so, I've got nothing to feel guilty about if, say, I gave you some?",Hotel
3,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Not really.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"OK. Well this is a big bag of drugs. And all I'm gonna do is just tape it on here like this. And then you know, have fun.",Hotel

3,6,Jeremy,Sophie,You're kidding?!,Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Jeremy,Is that Mark's fleece?,Hotel

3,6,Sophie,Jeremy,"Yeah, no I'm sure, it's just... I feel guilty, I was such an idiot and he just rushed out straight away to try and find me because he's so lovely like that. And I feel like I'm always the one, you know? He's such a good person, I'm always going on and on about the juice and the juice bar and smoothies. I mean, it's only fruit squashed up for God's sake!",Hotel

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Hello. Hello Jez.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"And I was right, you were wrong. Look, you're wet through and really unhappy, all because you didn't listen to me.",Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,What happened?,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,"Well, I sort of slipped into a kind of mini ravine and there was... I angered a crow that was defending its young and then I eventually got a bit of, not exactly sleep, in a disused barn.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, I was right. Look at you, you're actually shivering. Brilliant.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Mark,"Urgh, can't believe I pissed on my legs to keep myself warm.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,Thanks Soph.,Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,"So listen I just wanted to say I'm so sorry for last night and being a big idiot and, you know, you and me, we've had lots of ups and downs and I guess the truth is, we just have lots of differences and we have a lot of different interests and stuff.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, yeah, I know Soph, so-",Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,"But at some point, you just have to say OK, I don't live in a fairy tale and we can have our own interests and our own gang of friends and I might do a bit more clubbing and you might do a bit more... history. But that doesn't mean we can't have a nice time and neither of us are getting any younger and I might want some little people around some time soon. So what I'm saying is, yes.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,What to?,Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,"While you were out Mark, your alarm clock went off so I went into your bag to turn it off and I accidentally found something round and engagement-y!",Hotel

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"She said yes, she accepted.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,But you hadn't asked.,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"There was a ring, that's an effective proposal.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,So you accepted the acceptance?,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well I had to, it was checkmate, there was no way out.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Except for telling her how you felt.,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh right, yeah, sure like that was gonna happen. No I had to accept. It would have been too embarrassing not to accept to acceptance.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"What, so you're going to get married to her out of embarrassment?",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,There are worse reasons.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,I suppose you could always get divorced.,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh no, I'm not the divorcing type.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,So you're gonna stay married to this woman for the rest of your life because of embarrassment?,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, probably and look, I'd be grateful if for the rest of my life you never mention it again, OK?",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Fair enough. To the happy couple!,Hotel
3,6,Others,Mark,The happy couple!,Hotel

4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"Yeah, I went the year before last. But it was a bit much. Well, I took four cans with me, then this guy from security came up, and he said he was from security, but I don't think he really was from security. Anyway, then Dad came and picked me up.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"OK, that's an interesting story.",Chapman Homestead

4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God. The first fianc√© challenge and I've got a gun. An actual gun. It's OK, it's perfectly normal, this is the country, this is what farmers do. They go around shooting crows and trespassers and eventually, because of the EU, themselves.",Woods
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"...then I went to Warwick, but I left after a term. They were all a bunch of fakers. I still got the bag from the Freshers' Fair, though. Pretty cool bag. I'll show it to you later, if you want.",Woods

4,1,Mark,Ian,Its neck?,Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Yes, wring its neck, it's suffering.",Woods

4,1,Mark,Ian,There's blood all over me.,Woods

4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh shit, oh no.",Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,So...,Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,I have very little to say to my closest friends. What the hell am I gonna say to a fully grown man for a whole night?,Pub

4,1,Mark,Ian,"Yes, I do, sir.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, ""sir"". This isn't Tennessee, Mark.",Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Because that's all I care about. Because if there's one little crack of doubt, after thirty years... well, never get older, that's all I'm saying.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Right, yeah, that's good advice.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, here we go. He's got no-one else to talk to but the sheep and the trees. This is what happens if you live too far from proper franchised coffee outlets.",Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,"You need the love, Mark. Because the physical stuff, that goes, inevitably. That all goes.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Well, that's good, 'cause me and Soph, it's, you know... love.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Or my fear of loneliness and her strong desire to get pregnant by almost anyone, so long as it happens this year.",Pub
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Hello.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, alone with the mum. Just act normal. She doesn't know I'm not wearing any pants.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"Jez, I'm so delighted about you and Jamie. He hasn't had a proper friend since he was thirteen.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Oh, right, yeah. I mean, we only watched the Lion King and his Fatboy Slim DVD.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"Listen, I've been thinking, what with Ian's mum passed away, we've got the Volvo and the Subaru. Maybe you could have her old Golf.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Wow.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"You could come and see us, and Jamie.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Right, well, brilliant.",Chapman Homestead

4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Just some Blair resignation jam.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Oh, right, Blair, yeah. I see, nice.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"I theme my jams, it makes them more fun.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Cool, very cool.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Do you like jam?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Um, yep.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"Yes, sometimes I feel like I could do with a friend out here.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Yeah. It's good to have a friend.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Have a proper taste.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Suck Mummy's finger. Do I suck the finger?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Good?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Mmm, very good. I mean, I've got a girlfriend.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Try the Diana Memorial strawberry.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, I'm finger sucking. Is this wrong? Maybe this is totally normal. Maybe this is what they do in the country.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Good.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"You like it, don't you?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Yes, I do like it.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Try this.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Maybe she just likes having her finger sucked. I mean, I don't mind, but eventually it's going to get cloying.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,I expect you've noticed Ian's a little older than me. He used to enjoy doing lots of things that he doesn't like doing any more.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"No, yeah, I'm sure.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"So, there you are. I'm a woman.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Indeed.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,And you're a man.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Technically, mm-hmm, yes.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"So, what are you gonna do about that?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, it's not gonna be just the jam. So what am I gonna do? It's almost like a moral decision, but not really, 'cause no one will find out.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Goodbye beard, hello familiar, stupid face.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,So how did it go down the pub? Make a good impression?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Er, yeah, yeah. I think so. But it got me thinking about Sophie and the wedding and how I probably don't properly love her.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes. I think... I think I'm gonna call it off, Jez.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Wow. That's... I'm impressed, Mark.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Could go for a high five. Probably not the most appropriate time.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So, is that why, the beard?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,I thought you liked the beard.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Well I had to pretend that, even to myself. I mean, what sort of man would grow an unwanted beard to order?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So, when are you gonna call it off?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know, it's difficult. I mean, ideally, it would be somewhere with nice surroundings.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Somewhere with flowers, coffee and sedatives, medical assistance. Maybe with music, but not too jaunty. Melancholy music.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Right. So where are you planning to find this magical musical break-up hospital?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh shit! That'll be Sophie, looking for nookie. I can't see her now, pretend to be asleep.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Why don't you just finish it now?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I can't do it now. You don't just declare war, Jeremy. You prime the press, you square the UN, you make up your reasons. Snore.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Mark,"I heard you snoring, but you're not asleep.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Penny,"No, just... practicing. I was showing Jeremy some techniques.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Mark,"I'm sure Jeremy's got plenty of his own techniques. I just wanted to check you were back OK Mark, and say how lovely it is to have you both here. Night.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Please, no. Please, tell me no.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"That, the smutty smile. Jeremy, please tell me that nothing's going on there.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Nothing is going on there.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,Let's just say that nothing is going on there.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. Actually, I did want to tell someone. I mean, it was so cool. She had all this jam-",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, my God, you didn't! You fucked her! Jeremy, you need chemical castration, you're out of control! That's Sophie's mother!",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,She's hot.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"She's not out of Hollyoaks Jeremy! She probably had a ration book! Oh, you're a piece of work, aren't you! I'm down in the pub putting the hours in with the dad and you're back at the house banging the mum! That is not a good impression.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't know, I think I made a pretty good impression.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, please, don't smile like that. You're not James Bond. You're disgusting.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,I am James Bond.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,"I'm sorry you have to be out here with me watching this. Just me walking about, basically. Penny wanted us out of the house and what Penny wants, Penny gets.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"No, it's fine. I mean, if I wasn't here I'd just be sitting around with Soph. I can see her any time.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So come on, Mark, why haven't you told her yet?",Woods
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Shh, can he hear?",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,He can't hear.,Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"Can you, you big fox-hunting, badger-baiting tweed-shirt bumfuck homophobe? Oh, shit.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,Bottle cap. Another one for the collection.,Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So come on, are you having second thoughts?",Woods
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know, maybe. I mean, she's so nice. So what if I don't really love her. Charles didn't really love Diana and they were all right. Sort of.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,You don't really love Sophie?,Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"What, no.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,That's what you said.,Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"No, I didn't.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Yes, you did.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"No, no, because of... distortion. There was probably a buzz. There might be an ancient Saxon coin right here.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Stop it, Mark. I heard every word.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,"And for the record, Jeremy, I may be a homophobe but I'm no badger baiter.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"So, I like your barn, Ian.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,It's full of crap no-one has any use for. Maybe that's why I feel so at home here. Ha.,Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Mark, if you don't love Sophie, you shouldn't marry her.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Yes, that's what I've actually been thinking. That's what I'm gonna tell her.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Mark,The good-impression thermometer is reaching absolute zero.,Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"For what it's worth, I'm sorry.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"You know what, I'm glad. I'd rather you came clean now than start something that's not right. That actually takes balls.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Well, thank you.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Sometimes, I wish I had the guts to say something. Do something. What would you do if you were trapped in a loveless marriage? If you knew your wife was cheating on you?",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Shit!,Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"You know what, I'd probably just leave it. Let it slide. So, what's the best bit of metal you've ever detected?",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,"I know my wife. And I know who the culprit is, Jeremy.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh my God, that's why he brought us out here. He's gonna kill me. Can you kill someone with a metal detector?",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Ian, I just wanna say that I know that people can be very stupid and selfish but really, it's our fast-food culture of instant gratification you should be angry with.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"No, Dan. Fucking Dan Walker.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, thank you, Dan, whoever you are.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,"Penny's probably been doing his curtains all day. Out you lot go, I'm ramming Dan. Oh, yeah, it was Ramadan at his place today, but he's no Muslim.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,Dan. What a filthy-,Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,Maybe it's time I did something. Show Dan who the lord of the manor is around here. What do you think?,Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Er, well maybe we should just-",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"Yeah, let's get Dan. Punish Dan.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"There it is, Dan's barn.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,Or you could just post something negative on the internet or blank him in the Post Office? That would send out a pretty horrible message.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"This is the law of the jungle, this is an eye for an eye.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,And you're sure you're poking the right man in the eye?,Dan's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,Light it.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Well, this is not what I expected. You think you'll be playing Simpsons Monopoly and you end up an arsonist. Still, at least it's not me he's trying to incinerate.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,What was all that about? Trying to get him to poke me in the eye? Let him poke Dan in the eye.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, so instead of you facing up to your responsibilities, poor old Dan's going to wake up with his barn burned, saying goodbye to his no-claims bonus.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, stop moaning. We're out with a man who owns guns. You're chucking his daughter, and I've screwed his wife. Tonight is going, if a bit weird, extremely fucking well for us.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I suppose you're right. Plus, maybe burning stuff is... not normal but less of a big deal out here than it is in a major conurbation.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Exactly. I nick your milk, you burn my barn.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Like scrumping, for apples.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,That'll teach him to put his dick where it's not wanted.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"Yeah, take that, barny.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh God, I'm a firestarter. A twisted firestarter.",Dan's Barn

4,1,Mark,Sophie,Happy birthday. I hope it'll be a memorable day.,Outside
4,1,Mark,Mark,Of course it's gonna be memorable. The day she's humiliated and broken in front of her family.,Outside
4,1,Sophie,Mark,So what happened with the beard? We didn't get a chance to speak.,Outside
4,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, that. When I was shaving, I sort of slipped and I tried evening it out but it just got smaller and smaller until I looked like an evil overlord, so I just lost it.",Outside
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, the new look.",Outside
4,1,Mark,Sophie,I know.,Outside
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Yes, your jurisdiction over my face is hereby rescinded. Shit. But can I really break it to her? Should I? I mean, she's lovely, she's attractive. She does irritate me, but everyone irritates me.",Outside
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"So, I was wondering if you'd listen to my track. It's probably shit but you can smoke a joint and it might sound all right.",Outside
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"Mmm-hmm, great.",Outside
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"So, it must be amazing, London. What's it like down the King's Road?",Outside
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"Oh, cool. It's got a Pret, it's got a Virgin Express, it's got a Gap and a massive Cafe Nero.",Outside

4,1,Sophie,Penny,Nana's cottage?,Outside
4,1,Penny,Sophie,It's yours and Mark's. To do whatever you want with.,Outside
4,1,Sophie,Penny,"Oh, Mum!",Outside
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, my God. Nana probably needs the roof and brickwork looked at but apart from that, this is premium real estate. Quick sale, then a cottage in the Ardennes. Or a flat in Barcelona.",Outside
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, Mark, Nana's house, and it's all ours!",Outside
4,1,Mark,Sophie,I know!,Outside
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Who cares if I don't know if I properly love her? She could have the flat in Barcelona, I can live in the Ardennes. We'd hardly see each other.",Outside
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"So, you must have listened to my track by now, right?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,Mmm-hmm.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,Yes! What did you like about it?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,I like the lyrics.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,There aren't any lyrics.,Chapman Homestead

4,1,Mark,Sophie,Happy birthday.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Come on, Mark, you've got to grasp the nettle, mate. I really don't want you to leave it too late.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Right, it's just, as a matter of fact, I've had a bit of a think and I'm not really sure I want to- I don't think I want to-",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,Is this because of Nana's cottage?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,"God, no, not because of Nana's cottage. Of course not, there are a lot of factors.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,Like what?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Myriad factors, I can't just think off the top of my head.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,You either love her or you don't.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Hey, nice to see you two getting on. What are you chin-wagging about?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, just metal.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,And the fact that I don't really love you.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Sophie,"So, Dan Walker's barn. Apparently it looks suspicious.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Sophie,Penny,"Oh, no, poor Dan.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Penny,"Boo hoo, poor old Dan.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Ian,Maybe you should make that your last glass.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Penny,"Poor, poor Dan. Poor old Dan. There's a reason you're so sad for Dan, isn't there? Because you're such good friends with Dan, aren't you, Pen?",Chapman Homestead

4,1,Sophie,Ian,Dad!,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,Anyone for a game of Risk?,Chapman Homestead

4,1,Mark,Ian,Cranium?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,"The truth game. Penny doesn't want to play. How about you, Mark?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,Me?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,Tell us the truth.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,"The truth? ""You can't handle the truth!""",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,Tell everyone. Come clean about you and Sophie.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Do you know, I fancy a nap. A nice relaxing nap.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,Tell them you don't wanna marry her.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Sophie,Mark,Mark?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,That is a terrible thing to say.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,Tell the truth.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,The truth... the truth is that I love Sophie very much and am very much looking forward to marrying her.,Chapman Homestead

4,1,Ian,Mark,"Right, thank you.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,"He did it. He made me and Jeremy watch, so we'd be accessories to the crime, but I'm breaking down your wall of silence, Ian. Even if you did threaten to break my fingers.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Is this true?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Well, I did see him throw a petrol bomb, but I thought that might be a joke.",Chapman Homestead

4,1,Sophie,Mark,"It's not your fault, he gets like this.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Sophie,"Yes, he has gone like a bit of a maniac.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Ian,"In fact, I think it's probably time you took your leave, Ian.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Ian,"Yes, why don't you piss off up to bed and leave me to pick up the pieces as usual.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Penny,Sod you all.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,"OK, in a way, I've made a good impression. I mean, it wasn't me who set fire to the barn or screwed Penny. In fact, I'm winning. I'm getting half a rural cottage and all I have to do is enter a loveless husk of a marriage.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Dad has gone to his sister's, so I'd better stay over a couple more nights, till Mum's feeling OK.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Am I evil? I don't feel evil. It's a nice cottage. He did burn the barn. Maybe I've gone over the edge, I no longer know right from wrong. Maybe I'm capable of murder. It would certainly make life more interesting.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Get yourself a nice tank of petrol.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"OK, thanks.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Come back soon.,Chapman Homestead

4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Bye, love you.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Sophie,I love you too.,Chapman Homestead

4,2,Johnson,Mark,"OK, now is the time for you to know the meaning of Project Zeus. The meaning of Project Zeus is, why can't Marketing be an arm of Sales?",JLB
4,2,Mark,Johnson,"I don't know Alan, thousands of reasons, but also kind of... none. But won't Marketing kick up a shit-storm?",JLB
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"Uh-huh. And that's why I've booked you and me in for a presentation to the board. I'll leave the details up to you. But if you persuade them, we co-manage a new super-department. But if we fail, well, you're the junior guy, you take the bullet.",JLB
4,2,Mark,Johnson,Christ.,JLB
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"Exactly. So, uh, you're gonna need a team. I'll assign you some slave drones. Milk them till they're dead. We just need them sweating facts and shitting stats for us till D-Day, OK?",JLB

4,2,Jeremy,Johnson,It certainly is an indecent proposal!,Jeremy's Room
4,2,Johnson,Jeremy,You have a property of which I wish to make a use. Is that so very different from hiring a solicitor or leasing out a Spanish villa?,Jeremy's Room

4,2,Mark,Sophie,"It could have been. I was careful to be sure that it could have been. Come on, Soph, you want us to enjoy the executive lifestyle together. I was nice to you, even when you gave me that shit about the earnings projection.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Mark,I just don't think that's how you should treat people. You should be nice.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh, sure, it's nice to be nice.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Mark,Should we just go down and get some dinner?,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, have your nice fancy dinner, till the bill comes and the bodies start piling up.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Gerrard,Come in.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Sophie,"OK, fine.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Gerrard,"Well, I guess it's just Gerrard and me from here on in, right, Gerrard?",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Gerrard,Mark,Sorry?,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Gerrard,"I said it's just you and me from here on in, right?",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Gerrard,Mark,"Right, sorry, sorry. I've got a mucus build-up in my ears, so...",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Mark,"See you later, then.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Gerrard,"Cool, cool, dude. Sit down, clear your tubes, 'cause you and me are gonna chow down on the biggest hairy motherfucking business shit-storm since Enron.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Sales, Marketing, Marketing, Sales. All I'm doing is scrolling up and down this useless document, inserting words almost at random. I suppose I can always roll Gerrard out for the sympathy vote. He's my dark secret, my Elephant Man.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey hey, it's me! Surprise visit!",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,I can see it's you. What the hell are you doing here?,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm here to party, man!",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"You're following Johnson and Big Suze, aren't you? You're gonna do something disruptive, aren't you?",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"No, no, God no. Maybe. Listen, I need to find Big Suze. There's no answer at her room, so...",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,Why do you even want to get back with her? She was really starting to annoy you.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,That was before we stopped going out.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, right, so now she's finished with you, suddenly you're in love with her again?",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Exactly, duh. That's how love works, Mark.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"Hi, it's Charles.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,Johnson.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Johnson,Mark,Is that Camilla?,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Johnson,"Yeah, this is Camilla.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Mark,"God, that's so humiliating. Why couldn't we have been Holmes and Watson? Or Ben and Jerry? Even Bernie Winters and Schnorbitz would've been an improvement.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"So, how's Project Zeus coming along?",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Mark,Oh shit.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Johnson,"Oh, it's going really well, actually. I think I've cracked it, Alan.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Johnson,Mark,Cool. So let's roll out somewhere spicy and celebrate. Sales is gonna get shitfaced with Marketing.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Johnson,Although there are actually a few pesky I's to dot and a few T's for me and Gerrard to-,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"Hey, just bring your laptop along, dude.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Johnson,Alan-,Kettering Hotel Room

4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Hey, Suze.",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Jeremy, what the hell are you doing here?",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Me, nothing. I was just passing through Kettering, and I thought, hey, I know someone who's gone to Kettering for the weekend.",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,Jez...,Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Honestly, I was always coming to Kettering. I like it here, it's a party town. Look, come on, Suze. I mean, let's sort this. What do you see in Johnson?",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,I just like him.,Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,Come on. Is it because he's black?,Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,What? No! I hadn't even noticed.,Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Well, you're making a mistake, Suze, because he's terrible at being black. I'm a better black man than he is.",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,That sounds almost-,Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Look, Suze, being black isn't about the colour of your skin. It's about vibe, about hanging out, kicking back, smoking a number, fighting prejudice and negative stereotypes wherever you find them, yeah? I'm down with all that. Is Johnson? I mean, what's Johnson done for black people lately?",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Well, you mean apart from his mentoring and his community work?",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Yeah, apart from that.",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you tried to sell my body to another man for private gain. I don't want to talk to you, goodbye.",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Jeremy,Others,"I did not try to sell her body to another man. I tried to rent out her sexual organs, on a one-use basis.",Kettering Hotel Bar
4,2,Big Suze,Mark,I've always wanted to come somewhere like this. I love the funny women taking their clothes off and you lot just gawping.,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Big Suze,Wasn't that last one a bit... thin?,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"Relax, Mark, we're relaxing. You don't want a great fat lap dancer, do you?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, this is horrible. Urgh, she's touching the tube! That can't be hygienic.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"How's that looking, Mark? Looking good, right?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Johnson,"Oh, it is looking so good, Alan.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Mark,Maybe I can work in a back room. There must be a back room somewhere that isn't full of mobsters or sallow men getting wanked.,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Big Suze,Mark,"I think I'm gonna get you a dance. That's what I'm gonna do, Mark. That's what you need.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Big Suze,"No, Suze, I- I really don't think I really have time, and Soph and everything.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Big Suze,Mark,An early wedding present.,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Big Suze,Lap Dancer,"Hello, you, yes, you. Would you do one to him, please? Thanks.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Big Suze,"Suze, I really-",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Big Suze,Mark,Shh.,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Mark,"I'm being forced into this, that's the line.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"Hi, and what's your name?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"Uh, Mar-tin.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"Nice to meet you, Martin.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh great, here we go. I'm just another cock getting wired into the global economy. Urgh, how should I look like? Bond-like neutrality? As though I'm so used to real-life naked women? Or... don't want to be rude. Smiling encouragement? That's not a leer, is it? Got to avoid the leer at all costs. And the dribble. Oh God, she looks amazing. This really should not be allowed. This is what men want, and we shouldn't be allowed to have it, because it's horrible and it makes you feel sick. Oh great, now I'm getting an erection. How grimly predictable. When's the work gonna happen?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"I'm very sorry, and you're a very attractive woman, but I have got a hell of a lot on, so...",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,Do you want me to stop?,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"No, no, you go ahead, you're obviously very talented, but I should just get on with this.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,What are you writing?,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"Oh, just a proposal, so...",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"Well, you haven't written very much, have you? You should try and sum up all your aims in the first line.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"Right, this is a very complex business proposal, so I really don't think you could sum up all the aims in one line.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"If you can't sum up all your aims in the first line, then they're too diffuse.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"Look, my aims are not too fucking diffuse, OK?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"Fine, Jesus. They just might be too diffuse, that was all I was saying.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Great, now I'm getting an angry lap dance, brilliant.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"Hey, Mark, how are you feeling?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Johnson,Relaxed. I feel really very relaxed.,Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,So you didn't fancy a night out with the team?,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"Jez, they were going to a lap dancing place.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,Really? God. Men. Do you wanna...?,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Jeremy,I should probably keep a clear head.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Oh, go on. Before you get your booty locked up by Captain Corrigan.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,She's so cool and nice. How did Mark even manage to get anything going with her? I guess she must have some massive character defect that only becomes apparent after a while.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Jeremy,So how's it going with Big Suze?,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Oh, pretty terrible. I mean, I came to try and win her back, but I don't even know if I like her, or...",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"I sometimes wonder what I'm doing with Mark. Getting married. I mean, whether he's really into me. And have I lived enough? I've only slept with four men, is that enough?",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Four? Oh, yeah.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Jesus, I've had sex with more men than that and I basically only sleep with women.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"I mean, you might slip another one or two in just to get your average up.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Jeremy,I don't know if I'm attractive enough to.,Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Oh, you're attractive. You're a hottie, Soph, you're hot.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"Oh, that's nice, thanks, Jez. You're pretty hot too.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Well, here's to being hot.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit, is this gonna happen? This is almost definitely a terrible idea. But I won't know for certain until I've actually done it. Nope, I was right, that was a terrible idea. That's probably the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. Although, maybe actually screwing each other will kind of make it weirdly better.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Mark,"Hey, Markie!",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Sophie,"Hello, just need to grab some files and some ProPlus and Nurofen. I'm pulling an all-nighter with Gerrard.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Cool, right, well. I'll probably head off. You know, get some sleep in the utility area.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, will you be OK? There's always the bathroom floor.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"No, mate, no, no. No, I'm fine in the utility area. I've got it all set up, you know, a couple of bog rolls for a pillow, and a wicked big tarpaulin.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Good, that sounds nice.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"You're a bloody good guy. God, you're a great guy.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Isn't he a bloody good guy, Soph?",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Sophie,Mark,"You're a great guy, you're a fucking great guy.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Why are they being so nice? Maybe they've been having a big chat about me and they've suddenly realised that I was right about North Korea, I was right about the European Constitution, and by God, I think I'm right about the Congestion Charge.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, I feel terrible. I feel like my head's gonna explode. Relax, Mark, heads don't explode. It's much more likely you'll just get a tumour.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Gerrard,"So, half an hour till the board roll in and I pitch this mother. This is it, it's just you and me from here on in.",Kettering
4,2,Gerrard,Mark,Sorry?,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Gerrard,I said it's just you and me from here on.,Kettering
4,2,Gerrard,Mark,"Right, sorry, yes. It's the mucus, this side.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Gerrard,"Yes, of course. OK, so, final analysis. What have we actually got, what am I gonna present to the board? Not that, that sounded good at 3am when we were high on Diet Coke. That's bullshit. That's just table talk, that's not fit for public consumption. This... is that it? Where's the actual sustenance, where's the beef? Gerrard, we've got... there's... nothing. I've got nothing, I've got fucking nothing here. We haven't got anything. We've spent all night doing nothing, Gerrard, you prick!",Kettering
4,2,Gerrard,Mark,"I've been working very hard, trying to-",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Gerrard,"You cocksucker, you stomach-levels bullshit wanker!",Kettering
4,2,Gerrard,Mark,"That's enough, Mark, all right? You can't talk to me like that.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,I've lost my Elephant Man. My beautiful Elephant Man.,Kettering
4,2,Jeff,Mark,"How's it going, mate? Everyone's excited.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeff,"Jeff. Jeff, listen, Jeff. Your- your idea. Have you still got the printout, the idea, the three-department merger?",Kettering
4,2,Jeff,Mark,The one you went and wiped your arse on?,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeff,"Yeah, except that wasn't actually that funny, was it? Have you got a copy?",Kettering
4,2,Jeff,Mark,"Yeah, sure, mate. Here it is. Ha ha ha ha!",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I feel so bad about betraying Mark. Still, another snog for Jez's snog book. Hmm, he looks terrible. Looks like he could do with a friend.",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,Mark?,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, I really hope I don't still smell of Sophie.",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"What's on the piece of paper, Mark?",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,Is there something on that piece of paper that's made you sad?,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"You know what this piece of paper says, Jeremy?",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,Is it something to do with history? Have they stopped history books?,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,This piece of paper says that I am fucked.,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, that's horrible, who sent you that?",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,It's my plan for Project Zeus.,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,Let's have a look.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,That's what I've got to go through that door and pitch to the entire JLB board in ten minutes.,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,Shit.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,I'm about to walk into a boardroom gangbang and get fucked by the biggest swinging dicks in corporate strategy.,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,Maybe you should run away.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, thanks Jez.",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, I mean, people say it like it's a bad thing, you know, running away from your problems. But if your problems never catch up with you, what's the hitch?",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, well in this case, there would be repercussions.",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,What do you care? You'd be in the woods playing the ukulele with the rabbits and the squirrels.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,I suppose I could run away.,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Do it, man!",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I think that was good advice. I mean, I didn't actually expect him to do it. Maybe I wouldn't have said it if I'd thought there was any chance of him actually doing it, but, yep, there he goes.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,"God, I'm running away. This is brilliant. Maybe I'll go to a KFC and have a whole bargain bucket. Or I could join Al Qaeda. Maybe I'll marry my lap dancer. I do think, in a weird way, we had a connection. Fuck the Blockbusters fine, I'm going clear!",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Hiding out in a car park. He's not exactly Grizzly Adams, but it's a start.",Kettering
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,Jeremy!,Kettering
4,2,Johnson,Jeremy,Where's Mark? What the hell are you doing here?,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Johnson,"I know my rights. I've spoken to my friends at the Citizens Advice Bureau. Pay up, or I shall make a disturbance.",Kettering
4,2,Johnson,Jeremy,"OK, sure, fine. If it'll make you feel any better, here. Three hundred and eighty pounds, cash. Will that do?",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Johnson,I'll take it. And you know what? This means nothing to me.,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"I haven't got a penny in the world, Suze, but this means nothing to me without you. [Jeremy throws the cash out of the window] There, you see? Now do you see? That's how I feel. Now will you go back out with me?",Kettering
4,2,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Uh, no, Jez. I'm just not really that into you.",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"In that case, if you'll excuse me.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Shit, this could be difficult to row back from. This isn't a misspelt email. This is going feral. I mean, rejecting society and seeking the company of wild creatures, that's not going to look good on my quarterly review. What's Jeremy stealing, hotel napkins?",Car Park
4,2,Sophie,Mark,Mark?,Car Park
4,2,Mark,Sophie,Soph!,Car Park
4,2,Sophie,Mark,"What the fuck? Why are you hiding behind a bush, aren't you meant to be in the big meeting?",Car Park
4,2,Mark,Sophie,"It doesn't work, Soph. Project Zeus, it's unworkable. What am I gonna do?",Car Park
4,2,Sophie,Mark,"Hey, look, it'll be OK. You know what? You should just go in there and tell the truth.",Car Park
4,2,Mark,Sophie,"The truth? Soph, this isn't an advert, this is real life, where cocks get chewed off and arses get stuffed with compliance reports!",Car Park
4,2,Sophie,Mark,"Look, I know it's corny, but just tell them. This is real life, smelling the flowers. All that reports up bums stuff, that's the bullshit. Just tell them the truth. You're sorry, but you tried.",Car Park
4,2,Mark,Sophie,Do you really think?,Car Park
4,2,Sophie,Mark,Of course.,Car Park
4,2,Mark,Sophie,Maybe she's right. Maybe the truth does work. Maybe Iraq was a good idea. Maybe I am putting enough into my pension plan. Maybe computer games aren't a waste of time. Maybe OJ's innocent! Maybe everything's gonna be OK!,Car Park
4,2,Johnson,Mark,"Everyone's wondering why you climbed in through the window, Mark.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Johnson,"Yeah, well, I don't play by the rule book, what can I say?",Kettering
4,2,Board Member,Mark,You don't use doors?,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Board Member,Every window is also a door.,Kettering
4,2,Board Member,Mark,Not every window.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Board Member,"Well, that depends. I mean, not tiny windows like lavatory windows.",Kettering
4,2,Johnson,Board Member,"OK, Mark is now going to take you through the detail of Project Zeus.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Johnson,Right.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Here I go, palms dry, mouth dry, inter-buttock area moist.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Board Member,"So, integrating Sales and Marketing, Project Zeus. The bad news is, it doesn't work. But, look, big picture, so what? Maybe we shouldn't be in the credit business at all. Maybe we should look at human rights or global warming. I mean, these are just ideas, but... where's the humanity? I suppose that's what I want to ask you today, if anything, where is the humanity? Old friend.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Shit, I'm crashing and burning. That stupid bloody hippie sold me down the river. Plan B. What is plan B?",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Board Member,"Right, OK, you can stop the murmuring. Please stop murmuring. Unless you think it's nice to murmur at someone who's... dying!",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,Did I just say that? I did just say that.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Board Member,"Yep, that's right, I've got brain cancer. Half my brain's been eaten away already, probably, but I think I did a pretty decent job for a man with a brain tumour the size of a pineapple who's gonna be dead within a month.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Uh, plan C, is there a plan C?",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Board Member,"My brain, my poor diseased brain!",Kettering
4,2,Johnson,Board Member,Yup. I'd just like to assure everyone here that Mr. Corrigan will indeed be dead in a month.,Kettering

4,3,Mark,Sophie,Yep. Everything all right?,Kitchen
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Yup, fine, sure.",Kitchen
4,3,Mark,Mark,"It's what I said about her trainers. She shouldn't have asked me if she didn't want to know. They are a bit clumpy. She's so moody. I'm marrying her, what more does she want?",Kitchen
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,What are you doing?,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Just doodles. It's a logo for when people are in touch about doing baseball caps with my initials on.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Right. Good to be prepared. Jeremy, is that post? Are you doodling on my post? When exactly were you going to tell me about this? Oh my God. It's from Matt Townsend!",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Who's Matt Townsend?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"He's only the best personal trainer is South London according to Johnson. He's got a window. Jeremy, he's got a window and he's opening it for me.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, are you having some kind of mental breakdown?",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Just joining a gym. Get some exercise and some time, not away from Sophie, just without her. You should join up too, you get a free pen.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't need to pay money to join a gym. The world is my gym. The hills, the trees, the rivers, they are my gym.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, well, the world is my gym too, it's just the bit of it that's actually a gym, that's going to be my gym. Is that Big Suze?",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,It's her birthday. I'm going to pick the most savage ones and then post them to her.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,So I take it you haven't got over her going off with Johnson.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"No, I have. This is how I've got over it. Right. Have you got any spare carrier bags? 'Cause I'm going out to collect some dog shit.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,My new life has begun. Everything is going to be different.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Well done today, dude. You've slacked off a bit on the treadmill at the end. Remember Mark, a champion is someone who gets up even when they can't, OK?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"OK, yeah.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,That's probably exactly the kind of bullshit I'm going to need to believe in my new life.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"That was your basic program, but maybe we should talk about any special goals you've got.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,My goals,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,Does hiding from my fianc√©e count?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"No goals, really. Apart from trying not to die and get in shape for my wedding.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"You're getting married? Wow, congratulations.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Thanks.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"It's fine, just a couple of normal guys. Oh great, here comes the inevitable massive dong. Just look away. If I don't look at it, it can't hurt me.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,You don't sound over the moon.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Oh no, God, I'm over the moon.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,You're not taking a shower?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Oh, uh, no. No, I shower at home.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Oh it's good to, you know, it clears the pores after a workout.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Sure, yeah I'm down with that. No, it's just at home I have a system.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,A system?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Yeah, it's complicated. I don't want to waste water so I have my own methods, but they're all totally normal. I'll explain them to you sometime over a beer. See you Friday.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,See you.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, that was horrible. Now he probably thinks I'm embarrassed about the size of my penis, when in fact I'm not. I'm much more concerned about my misshapen scrotum.",Gym

4,3,Mark,Nancy,"Oh my God, Nancy! I didn't know you were, I mean, I haven't seen you since-",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Mark,Since I took off after marrying Jez?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Nancy,"Yeah, so what have you been up to?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Mark,"Well, when I left you guys I was supposed to hang out with these Belgian nuns, but then I got waylaid and ended up on crystal meth assistant managing the IMAX in Bradford for, like, a year and a half.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Nancy,"Oh, right. Well, it's really nice to see you again.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Mark,"Yeah, no it's a great to have some downtime working here, 'cause all that crank totally fucked with my mind. I mean, it was pretty well blown to pieces by the size of the IMAX image every day anyway, so...",Gym
4,3,Mark,Nancy,"Oh, yeah. Cranking at the IMAX. Don't I know it.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"I've got to tell Jez about Nancy. This will blow him away, or could tip him over the edge. Maybe it would be kinder not to tell him. It would certainly give me a weird feeling of secret power. Jesus, what's that man doing? I should do something. If decent people like me do nothing, then what? Then they'll come for the trade unionists, although that, to be honest, wouldn't really bother me too much. Hey, I know that weird run!",Outside
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Jeremy?!,Outside
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Mark?,Outside
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,What the hell are you doing?!,Outside
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, I got a bit drunk and posted that stuff to Big Suze, and then I sobered up and sort of had second thoughts.",Outside
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"For God's sake, Jeremy, that's the post you set fire to, the Royal Mail. That's like burning a swan.",Outside
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, shit. Come on.",Outside

4,3,Mark,Mark,Finally.,Outside

4,3,Mark,Mark,"I should tell him about Nancy, but I don't want to distract him from this massive dawning realisation.",Outside
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,I can't believe you saw her last night but waited till this morning to tell me.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Last night you were in a very emotional state.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,And by the morning the weird feeling of secret power had started to wear off.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,She must be coming in soon.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"It's good though, isn't it, the gym? Kind of like being the member of a club.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Eva,"Excuse me, Eva? We're out of juice.",Gym
4,3,Eva,Mark,"Right, but you have had a lot of juice. There is an unwritten rule about drinking all the complimentary juice.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Eva,"Still, if it's unwritten... we do need more juice.",Gym

4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Well, here I am, in the country. Woops, better be going. Nice bumping in to you.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Yeah, we should get together. You know, have a drink, reminisce?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,About what? The time you screwed the next-door neighbour right after I moved in?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Or the good times. You know, the Robin Williams DVD marathon.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Come off it, Jez. You said he was a moist-eyed camera-hogger.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Or our wedding day. I mean, that was a happy memory. Remember that, wifey?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"She's gone. Still, try again tomorrow, she'll probably feel a whole lot differently. So, can you give me another guest pass?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Another one?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,It's important.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"They're worth fourteen pounds each, I've only got three left, and I'd like the option to give one to someone else.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Who to? One of your friends?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, one of my friends. Or, I might need one for an emergency.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh come on, mate. How am I going to see Nancy again if you don't give me a pass? She clearly hates me.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, maybe you should take that as a sign.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,I'm not giving up that easily. Faint heart never won fair maid.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, the epigram that starts the stalker's manifesto.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Perfect. Job at the gym. If me and Nancy are trapped together, she'll naturally start to fancy me. Just like the way people fuck each other in prison.",Gym

4,3,Jeremy,Gym Manager,What's a novel?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Matt,It's pretty much a clean bill of health. I did think I had ringworm once but it turned out to be a cigarette burn.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Right, if you just want to whip off your top and assume the position.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Sorry?,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Massage, it's part of the warm-down.",Gym

4,3,Mark,Mark,"There isn't any chance at all I'm going to get an erection, is there? Oh my God, a man's hands all over my naked body. I'm so tense, I'm like Waterford Crystal, I'm going to smash into a thousand pieces.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,You feeling any more positive about the marriage?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Yeah, kind of.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Come on, Mark. The body's the greatest lie detector there is. If there's any more knots in these calves, we'll put you forward for a scout badge.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Well I- I suppose the truth is I'm not really sure I want to get married.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Whoa, shit that's heavy. I'm sorry to hear that. Right, well you need to get yourself mentally prepared dude. I can lend you this great book I've got on relationships.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,Urgh. It's like he's got one hand on my body and the other in my brain. Leave my brain alone. I get my brain training from Sudoku and Alain de Botton's weekly podcasts.,Gym

4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Jeremy?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Yup, I work here now. Amazing coincidence, yeah?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Yeah, amazing.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Look, Nance, since we're gonna be work colleagues now, I think it's important that I clear the air about me cheating on you. That was a terrible, terrible thing to do and I am sorry. You know, I haven't even really had sex since you left.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Really? Not even oral or footjobs or tromboning?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"No, sure, maybe a bit of oral, but I could never really enjoy it.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Look, Jez, I'm not gonna get back with you, but if we're working together I guess we may as well try and be friends.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Exactly, we'll be friends, like the friends on Friends.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Who were such good friends, they got bored of being friends and started screwing each other.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, what's new in your world?",Gym

4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,Great.,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"God, I'd really love to bone him.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Well that's what you should do, then. You should bone him. I'd like to watch. Only joking.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Must remember, watching someone you love having sex isn't that fun.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"How about you, you seeing anyone?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,No.,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,What about Eva? She doesn't have a boyfriend.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Don't think so, she's not really my type.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Is it because she's from the third world and used to live in a hut?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Poland isn't in the third world, Nance. They don't live in huts.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Well, still it's a shame. She's a great girl and she's like my best friend here.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Others,"Champers Spa, can I help?",Gym

4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"You know, I'm the first white English person on the cleaning staff. I'm getting a whole new view of life, the other side of the potato. They have these sandwiches, but they don't come from shops, they make them themselves.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"I make my own sandwiches, Jeremy. Making your own sandwiches is not an indication of a gritty life on the never-never.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"It's like Titanic. You're upstairs in your starched collar, while I'm down below decks dancing a jig with the Poles and the Africans, having a better time than you could possibly imagine.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Just make sure you clean up in the changing room toilet. There's a big pool of rusty water by the urinals and it turns my stomach.,Gym

4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, I've been thinking about what we discussed, and I do actually, definitely, fancy Eva.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Thought she wasn't your type?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Oh, Nancy, you know me, I don't really have a type. If it moves, I'll try and hump it. So tonight, why don't we all go to the cinema?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"OK, and why don't I invite Matt? Double date.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Fuck.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Yeah, but do you really wanna take the risk of asking him? There's a chance he might just laugh in your face and call you a slag.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Right, God no. Why don't you put in a good word for me with Matt, and I'll put in a good word for you with Eva?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Great, OK! We'll set it up for the staff party on Thursday.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Thanks, you're awesome Jez!",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, I'm awesome all right. I'm an awesome shit. I'm the cuckoo in the nest, the python in the toy box, and, quite possibly, the man of your dreams.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"It's Matt, isn't it?",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,And you are?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"Jeremy, yeah. I've got a message from Nancy on reception.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,The gorgeous blonde?,Gym

4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"Oh, shit.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"Yeah, she says you stare at her like a sex offender. And, if you keep doing it, she'll call the police.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"God! Well, she did smile at me once, so I just caught her eye. Could you tell her I'm sorry?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"I'll tell her. But she says if she sees you doing it again, she knows some bad dudes and they'll... do you even want to know?",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,I'd better.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,She says they'll rip your cock off and stuff it in your mouth.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,Jeez!,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,Sorry to be the messenger. Don't shoot me!,Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"No, dude, thanks for letting me know.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"It's cool. I've got your back, dude.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,And I've got your hairy plums in the palm of my hand.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Might as well pile on a few more spoonfuls. Who cares if I put on a bit of weight? I'm engaged to be married, mating season is over.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Mark, you're not full yet?",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"This is just fuel for the engine, Soph. I'll burn this off on the treadmill in, like, a second.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,Do you think we're a good couple?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,Uh oh.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Um, yeah. I mean, you've got to be realistic, we're no Edward and Mrs. Simpson, but, yeah.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,I think that was a good answer.,Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,Do you think we spend enough time together?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,Um...,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,Where's this going?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Well, yeah, I think we do.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"You just seem to spend so much time in the gym, you seem to love it so much, I was thinking maybe I might join.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,Shit!,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, well, that would be... great.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"I'd like to see more of Nancy and I think it'd be fun, the two of us doing something like that together. I could go on the exercise bike in front of you and we could pretend you were chasing me!",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Brilliant, she's located my bunker and now she's invading. She's flushing me out with dogs and grenades, and a sincere desire to spend time with me.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Staff party, Nancy, sauna, champagne. This is the kind of thing that should be happening to me on a daily fucking basis.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Jeremy, where's Eva?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Oh, she went to chill out in the flotation tank.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Right, aren't you two supposed to-",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"No, no. I made a joke about Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and she took offence, then she started getting really snitty about UK hip-hop so things just fell apart.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Oh, that's a shame.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Could use my sauna line.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Cor, it's like a sauna in here!",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Classic line. That is just a great line. Got to manoeuvre more dates into saunas.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, how's it going? Enjoy the party?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Not really. Matt spent the whole evening looking straight past me. Did you get a chance to talk to him?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"As a matter of fact, I did, yeah.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,How'd it go? What did he say?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,I probably shouldn't tell you.,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Oh, come on, please.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"He said he's not really into anything serious at the moment. He's looking for, quote-unquote, a fuck-monkey.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,A fuck-monkey? He said that?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Yeah, and not even the good kind of fuck-monkey.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,I can't believe he would say that.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Men do and say horrible things. I know I have, but I'm lucky because I've been given another chance to be your friend. And I wouldn't trade a moment of that friendship for a lifetime of fuck-monkey jungle action.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,What the-?,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,It's Eva in the flotation tank! She must have hit the panic button.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"The gooseberry's revenge! That hairy gooseberry, she couldn't just stay in her bloody punnet, could she?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,How did they get on there?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"I don't know, maybe some stoned weightlifter playing a prank or something?",Gym
4,3,Eva,Jeremy,I couldn't get out! It was so dark! So dark!,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Eva,"Still, there are worse places to get trapped, right? I mean, you must be bloody relaxed by now.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,Why do they have to park the bikes right in front of the sexualizer? Be so demeaning to get a bonk-on while exercising.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Yeah come on, dude, let's take it all the way up. Now can you take some more? Can you? Do you want it?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,What am I meant to say? Can I say no?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,I want it.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"He's broken me, I'll say anything now.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"That's alpine uphill. Now that's serious shit. Work it, big man. So how's the food plan going? What'd you have for dinner last night?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Well, I was late in so, the fridge was bare, I...",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"What was it, dude?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Pizza, from San Marco's.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"San Marco's?! When there's a sushi bar right next door? You know you're going to end up fat like a house. I mean, take a look at my stomach. Let's have a look at yours.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,Which is better?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,Could claim mine is better.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Yours.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Exactly, so no more pizza. What are you doing tonight?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Going to the pub with Jeremy.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,Don't go to the pub with Jeremy. Ask Sadie out for a smoothie.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Her? Why?,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,Well you need some more options now things are going down the shitter with Sophie.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Right, yeah, but be a bit quiet, maybe, Matt.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Oh relax, fat boy. Now, come on, let's take it up a notch. Let's rock it all the way to the top. Can you take some more? Do you want some more? Do you? Do you want it? Do you want it?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,No!,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,What?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"No, I don't want it, all right? Fuck off. You've made it too hard, I can hardly fucking pedal. No mountain is that hard, it's just not realistic.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, I've got two bits of bad news, one affecting me, and the other affecting you. Which do you want to hear first?",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Er, the one affecting me, then I can have the one affecting you as dessert.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, Nancy told me she spoke to Matt at Judo class and she's going to ask him out on a date.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,What?! What about all my fuck-monkey stuff?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah well, she said she decided it wouldn't be so bad spending all day eating bananas, and fucking with Matt Townsend.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, shit. That's disgusting. I'm depressed. What's your bad news?",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Sophie's planning to join the gym.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,What's so bad about that?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Because I've told Matt I don't really want to marry her.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Oh.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"She's getting dangerously close to my web of lies, Jez.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"But isn't it quite good if she does find out? I mean, you know, so you don't break both your hearts?",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"No, she can't ever know! It's all arranged, Jeremy, it's an arranged marriage. My dad literally congratulated me, Jez. He sent me a greetings card with a pre-printed message expressing a good deal of happiness. This is my chance to be a proper human being.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, yeah.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Like that's ever going to happen.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"And now Matt's going to spill the beans to Sophie or to Nancy and then she'll tell Sophie. What am I going to do, Jez?",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, what am I going to do? Maybe I'll tell Nancy Matt's got AIDS. But then she'd say, ""Sorry,"" and he'd say, ""Why?"" And she'd say, ""Oh, I thought you had AIDS."" And he'd say, ""No."" And then they'd just start fucking.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, both of us can't pace. It's like a prison yard in here.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Sorry.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,We need to get rid of Matt.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, get rid of Matt. And fast, before Nancy asks him out.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,We need a clever plan. What would de Botton do? An evil Alain de Botton?,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Kill him? There's an incinerator round the back of the gym.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"De Botton wouldn't kill, we're not going to kill him.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,We could say he poos in the pool.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,That's not beyond the realms of possibility.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"He'd definitely get the sack for that. Plus, what kind of a freak would do that? It should screw his chances with Nancy for good.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, could work. Although, I suppose, I mean, one of us would have to... in the pool.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"No, we just lie. Shame in a way, because I've always kind of wanted to poo in a pool.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Really? I did not know that about you.,Living Room

4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, my God! He actually- he couldn't resist!",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,Did you see Matt Townsend do this?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Well, I didn't actually see him, but I have my suspicions.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,Why?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,He mentioned to me that he likes to do that.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,He did?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Yes, he said he loves to do that.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,"OK, I'll have a word with Matt. My apologies, but I'm sure we can straighten this out.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Not straighten out, sack the innocent man!",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,There was that other thing.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,Another thing?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, the other thing. Remember, what you told me? About your knob?",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Oh uh, yes. I didn't want to mention that but... Matt, he touched my penis.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Others,"Karen, could you ask Matt Townsend to come to my office immediately?",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Matt,Gym Manager,They say I did a poo in the pool? And I touched him?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Matt,Yes.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,"Can you describe exactly what happened, Mr. Corrigan?",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Well, he was giving me a massage and he was going up my legs and my thighs, and then he touched my penis, and then he rubbed my penis quite a bit. I said stop, but he wouldn't stop.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Mark, why are you saying this? I don't understand.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Matt,Because it's true.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Please, don't do this, this is my career.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,You should have thought about that when you were touching his cock.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, this is all so horrible. Maybe it would have been simpler just to kill him. I should know how to kill someone by now, I've watched enough CSI.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,I can't believe they got rid of Matt.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Oh, Nance, he's a pool poo-er. You know what that means? He poos in the pool.",Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Right, I'm gonna beat your ass, Corrigan.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Maybe we'll be happy ever after. Maybe I'll look back and say Judo brought us together. Maybe we'll have a Judo-themed wedding, and get married in Judo suits, and I'll cut the cake with my hand.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Shit, Matt. He wants to punch and kick me, and he's come somewhere where he's allowed to punch and kick me.",Gym

4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"It's all right, Jez. Use your woman as a human shield.",Gym

4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"Well, you can't stay hiding there forever.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,He thinks we can't stay hiding here forever.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"He really doesn't know us at all, does he?",Gym
4,4,Mark,Mark,"What a dud evening. Low quality takeaway, low quality detective drama, low quality sexual intercourse.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"So, Soph, do you fancy coming along to my school reunion on Saturday?",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"School reunion, that doesn't sound very you.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, but I thought it might be nice to go and, you know, show them all that I've got a job and a flat and a fianc√©e now. And I'm not in fact a gender bender, a mentaloid or a public leaning post after all.",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Right. OK, the thing is, the thing, I think I mentioned. I'll be heading off late Saturday night.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,What thing?,Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,Frankfurt. Marketing development group? Me and Alan and Lisa and Jeff.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,Jeff's going to Frankfurt? You're going to Frankfurt with your ex?,Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Not with him. It's work, Mark. Did I not mention it?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"No, no, no you did not mention it.",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, well I thought you knew. Well you do now so...",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"Yes, I know now. But I didn't before.",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Well you do now, so...",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,All right.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Mark,"OK, definitely have a legitimate grievance here I reckon. Let's milk it.",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Mark, Jeff and I aren't going to fall into each other's arms in a pile of sauerkraut. I am getting married to you, OK?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, sure.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Maybe I should just go on my own. Sally Slater might be there. Mm, Sally, one of the few girls in my year to notice me and yet still not mock. It'd be good to see her again, and I'm sure Sophie won't mind. In fact, she's definitely not gonna mind 'cause I'm not gonna tell her.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yeah, great night at the pub this is. Laura's caught in Super Hans's tractor beam. Kerry's being all lovely to Mike about his mum's thyroid thing. I've got no way out. Stuck with the newbie, Mr. Fucking Shirt. Got to say something.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,So how do you know everyone?,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"I'm a friend of Bob's mate, Kev. And he said it was a friendly crowd and come down, so I thought, yeah.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Cool.,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Jesus, come on, throw me a bone.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,So have you got any plans for the weekend?,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"I'm doing a gig, actually.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Oh right.,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,Playing with my old outfit as The Orgazoid.,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"You're The Orgazoid? Oh my God, you're the- I thought you were just a man in a shirt sitting on a chair. Your first two CDs, I know every track. Borneo Function.",Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Right, nice.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Hans, this is- it's- it's not just a man. This is The Orgazoid.",Pub
4,4,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah, I know.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Super Hans,Well why didn't you say?,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Can I get you a drink?,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"I'm full of diet Coke here, man. Yeah, I haven't had a proper drink for six years. None of the party powder either.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"Oh right, I mean you've been as high as is possible to go.",Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Well, yeah, yeah I suppose I have.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,And you've been as low as it's possible to get.,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Yeah, yeah I have.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,And what's it like when you're up that high?,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,Ha. It's incredible.,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,And what's it like when you're down that low?,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Ah. It's terrible, it's horrible.",Pub
4,4,Super Hans,Russell,And er... what's it like when you're in the middle?,Pub
4,4,Russell,Super Hans,"It's er... you know, it's fine.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Wow.,Pub
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"So listen, weird question. I'm not sure if you're looking for work or what, but I'm looking for a kind of like handyman. My place is going to shit since I split up with my ex.",Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Well that sounds amazing.,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,Orgazoid's handyman. This is a dream come true. Handyman to chauffeur to keyboard player. It's a very well-established career path.,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh man, my job is the nuts. I had a great first day.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"By your job, you mean being a handyman for a man called The Orgazoid?",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"He's not a man, he's a band. He's one of the most brilliant techno pioneers of all time, and he's paying me five hundred quid a week, in advance, in cash.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"What?! Come on Jeremy, nobody gets paid five hundred pounds a week to do nothing.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,It's not nothing. Making smoothies from a smoothie maker is not nothing. You should try cleaning one of those mothers.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No, there's got to be a catch. You're gonna be his drugs mule. He's gonna sell your organs or invite a German around from the internet to eat you. And where did you even meet him? The snooker club that used to be a public toilet? Seriously, I'm concerned about this arrangement.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Why does everything good have to be some horrible arrangement? Me and Russell are just two guys having a nice time. That's what life is supposed to be like in case you've forgotten.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"All right, whatever. Look, I'm going out so-",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Going out?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"What? He's not going out. He can't, he doesn't know how.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Where? Who with?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Just to a nightclub.,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,A nightclub?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, well as you're always saying, the Beastie Boys fought - and possibly died - for my right to party so...",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, come on, what the hell's going on?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"All right, look, I've been invited to the Polefield School reunion at a school disco club, and-",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,They all hated you at Polefield.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, the vast majority, but there were some crumbs of comfort. The chess players, the musicians, the poor and the posh-voiced. We formed a substrata, a secret society below the radar of the norms.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,The norms?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"The normallows, the Norman forces, our oppressors.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, well this I have got to see. I could invite Nancy. Yeah, brilliant excuse to see her.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Haven't you got work in the morning?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah, that's really gonna break his balls if I roll in an hour late. Mark, this is Russell Orgazoid. He's a creative, I'm a creative. We don't make steam engines out of pig iron in this country any more, yeah? We hang out, we fuck around on the PlayStation, we have some Ben and Jerry's. That's how everyone makes their money now, yeah?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Here they all are, my tormentors.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Hope Nancy gets here soon. This is gonna be perfect. She won't know anyone except me.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"That's Faizel Butt. He used to call me a flod. I think it was a mixture between a flid and a spod. That's Foz. He used to sit behind me in French and put bacon on my shoulders. That's Terry Carpenter. One of the more sophisticated bullies. Pretended I was Thatcher and he was Heseltine, and I needed ousting. I need a drink.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, there she is. Lovely Sally Slater. I should speak to her, but what the hell can I say? Anything that doesn't mention I masturbate over her memory is probably good. I mean I think that's a compliment, but women just don't seem to want to hear it. No, just spend the evening looking longingly at her from a distance, like the good old days.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,Mark! Is it Mark Corrigan?,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Yeah, I forget, are you Sally? Good to see you. I have a job and a flat of my own now, so... it's great to see you. God, you look great!",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Thanks, so listen, can I get you a drink?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, OK, great.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,Maybe everything will be different now. Maybe all the parameters have shifted. Most of my rivals from school have probably perished in Blair's oil wars.,School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Nancy,Hey Nancy.,School Reunion
4,4,Nancy,Jeremy,"Hey, Jez, great idea. This is so much fun. Come here, meet these great guys.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,She made some friends pretty fucking quick.,School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"So now I'm finally doing an English degree, and I do a bit of cleaning to pay the bills. I listen to the set texts on my iPod when I'm hoovering.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Right, that's cool, I hoover sometimes because I bought my flat and that. From my job as an executive, I had plenty of cash left over to buy a hoover.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Are you boasting, Corrigan?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"No. I mean maybe a bit. Do you remember on that history field trip where you borrowed my Hitchhiker's Guide, and we both read it out in funny voices?",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,Yeah.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,I was thinking that was probably one of the best days of my life.,School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"What, really?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Should I feel guilty? No, Sophie's probably doing it with Jeff to the brutal rhythm of the Oompah band. Why shouldn't I have some mild flirtation? A snog even? Or more?",School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Sally,"Hello, sexy.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh, great, bacon shoulders.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Mark, you remember Foz?",School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Mark,All right Corrigan?,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Hi, Foz.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Please don't hit me for any reason, Foz.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,Foz and I are married now.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, right, great.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Obviously, of course. Why didn't I just buy an anvil and smash my face onto it? It would certainly be less hassle.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,So have you got kids?,School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Not yet, why?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Oh, no reason. I mean, I love kids. Not in a bad way, in a nice way. I mean I'm not on the child protection register... yet! Which proves I'm not a paedo!",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,This is going horribly. Need a joke.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,Either that or I'm an incredibly-hard-to-detect paedo.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,Just move on from the paedo area entirely.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, this is Foz and Sally, Jeremy.",School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Jeremy,"All right, mate. So, you're mates with Wankathon?",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Foz,I'm sorry?,School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Mark Wankathon, you remember? At school, when you got taught the wrong way to rub one out and you tried it for two hours.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit, this is just like school. Have to side with the powerful to survive.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Foz,Ha ha ha two hours!,School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Sally,"Oh, I fucking hate this track, it's brilliant. Come on saucepot.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh, just like school. I have to sit and watch while the beautiful people dance at me. Except no, she wants me to call her. It's worked. All my references to how much above the national average income I earn have actually worked!",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, making smoothies at The Orgazoid's house. This is the kind of job I deserve. I've paid my dues. All those years signing on every bloody week.",Russell's House
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Ah nice, thanks man. Yeah, take five if you want. Swim a few lengths.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"Oh, cheers, Russell. Yeah, maybe I will.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Nothing dodgy about this. Just going for a swim in my trunks. I can't swim in a three-piece suit, so screw you, cynics.",Russell's House
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Ah now listen, before I forget. I thought you might like this. I did a few different versions of Borneo Function that never got released. I thought you might get a kick out of them.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Oh my God.,Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, Super Hans is gonna shit a brick when I show him this. Finally, something to beat that car battery he nicked off The Prodigy.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"OK, well great chatting to you, Sally.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Hi, honey, I'm home.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sally,And good luck with Midnight's Children. Remember no one's ever actually finished it. Bye.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Great call, friendly but flirty. Didn't overstep the mark. I could show Sophie the transcript. Maybe I should start taping my phone calls. No, Mark. That's how they got Nixon.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,What's that?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, just a jumper Russell got for me.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,He bought you a jumper? What else has he bought you?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Nothing, Jesus. A squash racquet.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, what's going on? Squash racquets are not a normal form of remuneration.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"He doesn't have anyone to play with. And two people can't share one bloody racquet. Case closed, Columbo.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"So listen, I've organised a trip to the safari park on Saturday with Sally and Foz.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,The safari park? With that dickhead Foz? Have you gone mental?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,It's an ironical day out.,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, I get it. You're just another dirty dog like everyone else.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,I am not a dirty dog. But I do need you to come. As my... sheath.,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Your sheath?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, as long as you are there, it's just four people having an apparently nice time at an outdated venue.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Fucking hell, what's going on? Are you trying to get your end away while Sophie's not here?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Sophie has not called me once yet. So there is actually a perfectly valid excuse for what I'm almost certainly not going to try to do, OK?",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, if Sally was sitting here now, and she said, Mark, let's do it, what would you say?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,If she promised she wasn't a Glenn Close type and happened to have a recent clean AIDS certificate?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Yes.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,That's a hypothetical question. I don't answer hypothetical questions.,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,You're disgusting. But I like it. It's like going to a strip joint with the Pope.,Living Room
4,4,Foz,Sally,A fucking safari park?,Safari Park
4,4,Sally,Foz,"It's cool, it's retro.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Sally,Exactly.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,What exactly is my plan here? Lured them all to the safari park like a Bond villain. But what's the aim? Torture myself with contact with an unattainable woman? Or... what?,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it because of my job, but my boss was actually really cool about it.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,That's because it's not a real job.,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah, what about this? Is that real enough for you?",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Don't flaunt your wad, Jeremy, it's not becoming.",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Well you're becoming a pain in the arse. How do you like that?,Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Ha ha ha ha, you wanker, Corrigan.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Hey!,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,See how much money you earned this week.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Give it back, Jeremy!",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Not a lot in here, Mark, apart from a couple of moths.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Give that back!,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oops, butterfingers.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, for God's sake.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Foz, stop the car. Stop the car, Foz. He's- he's thrown my wallet out.",Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Oh my God, he never!",Safari Park
4,4,Sally,Foz,"Stop the car, Foz. It's Mark's wallet!",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,You gonna go and get it?,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No, we need to call the... warder.",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Don't be a dick. Go and get it.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,What if the lions eat me?,Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"The lions aren't gonna eat you, Mark. Just nip and get it.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,You should go and get it.,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,I'm not gonna get it.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Why should I have to bloody get it?,Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Come on, Mark, just get it. Get it.",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Fucking hell.,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, I'm getting big laughs off humiliating my best mate. How can something so wrong feel so right?",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Shit, this isn't good. There are lions, there are lions everywhere. Where are they? Is there one behind that tree? Jeremy's literally thrown me to the bloody lions. What's next, crucifixion? Is he gonna have me actually nailed onto a cross?",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Foz,You bloody bastards! Stop! Let me in! You bloody bastards!,Safari Park
4,4,Sally,Foz,"It's not funny, Foz. For fuck's sake, just stop.",Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Sally,"All right, all right, all right. Hold on here he comes, here he comes.",Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,Wahey!,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Christ, what do you do to avoid lion attack? Soil yourself? Or is that grizzly bears? Hate to shit myself for no reason and get eaten. The final humiliation.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,Still nothing from Sophie. Probably busy boning Jeff in Frankfurt. Highly unlikely but possible. I should at least try to feel jealous and betrayed. Then I'll feel less of a shit about pursuing Sally.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, hi Jez. ",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Nancy,Nancy.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"You're here, I thought you'd be down at The Orgazoid's.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well actually Russell had to go off to Norway this morning, so I'm just here. Is that all right, Dad?",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, yeah, but are you all right?",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, I'm fine.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,What's bothering him? He's thinking about something. He never normally thinks about things.,Kitchen
4,4,Nancy,Jeremy,So will you ask him now?,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Is it OK if Nancy uses the computer to redo her CV?,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,My computer?,Kitchen

4,4,Sally,Mark,"Listen, I'm so sorry about yesterday.",Kitchen

4,4,Sally,Mark,"But look, it was great seeing you, and it would be great to meet up again.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh right, well, I'd love to.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,How about tomorrow? I could drop around to your flat about three?,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Yeah, the flat, that sounds lovely.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,"I can't invite her around here. Anyone could be here. Sophie will find out. Nothing's gonna happen, but nothing must remain a total secret.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,"So, what's your address?",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"My address, hold on let me just check.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,You need to check your address?,Kitchen

4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Why?,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Just give it to me.,Kitchen

4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well that's OK, if you'd prefer, you can just give me the keys and I'll-",Kitchen

4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, you know, I'm his handyman.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"It's just, he did expect me to... give him a... hand.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,You gave him a hand?,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,I helped him out.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"You helped him out by giving him a hand. Wow, just to clarify, you do mean...",Kitchen

4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Shit.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,"I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"And now I don't know what to do. 'Cause on the one hand- one the one hand it's a really good job. But on the other, I don't really want to go back to that place or have anything to do with him.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"God, that's a really a tough decision.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Stay, stay so I can use the house.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I got Super Hans to fill in yesterday. Said I was sick. There's loads needs doing before he comes back, but I just feel a bit dirty, you know.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Mm-hmm, yeah. I know what you mean, I feel the same sometimes when I come back from JLB and I've had to do loads of spreadsheets.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't think it is the same, Mark. I feel like my soul is being chipped away bit by bit.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Welcome to the world of work, Jeremy. You know, you don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"And you don't have to be a smackhead to wank off old geezers, but that probably helps too.",Kitchen
4,4,Super Hans,Jeremy,Why didn't you tell me about the wanking off bit?,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Sorry, I didn't think.",Flat
4,4,Super Hans,Jeremy,Well you should have bloody thought. Jesus.,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Super Hans,Did you... do it?,Flat
4,4,Super Hans,Jeremy,Of course I did. How'd you think I got these trainers?,Flat
4,4,Nancy,Super Hans,What's going on? Who is wanking who off?,Flat
4,4,Super Hans,Nancy,Jeremy's been wanking off this bloke for cash.,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Nancy,No I haven't! It's not-,Flat
4,4,Nancy,Jeremy,Jeremy that is so you. I always knew you'd end up doing something like that.,Flat

4,4,Russell,Jeremy,I had a chance to think in Norway. Erm... about us.,Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Us? Yeah?,Russell's Car

4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Well, I want you to keep doing it, but I want you to do it because you want to do it.",Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,It's just I don't really want to do it. Could I start wearing a mitten? Or maybe chuck a flannel over it?,Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,It's just really difficult for me because I really like you. I just don't think we should see each other for a while. I'm going away to get my head together.,Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"No, but the thing is I really like you too. I've been hiding my true feelings, even from myself, but now they're all coming out. What a lot of feelings!",Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"I'm sorry, Jez.",Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,Home studio slipping away.,Russell's Car

4,4,Russell,Jeremy,No Jeremy.,Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"Come on, mate, let me have a go on the old gear stick. I'll take it up to fourth.",Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"This is not what I want. Fuck off, Jez.",Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"So, as it stands, I'm failing to find work as a prostitute. That doesn't feel good. Still, got his house keys. If I keep working for him, he'll have to keep paying me.",Russell's Car
4,4,Sally,Mark,So this is your flat?,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"This is it. I call it a flat because I'm quite modest, but as you can see, it's actually quite a massive house.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Shit, am I seriously hoping to have sex with Sally Slater? This is all very wrong.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"I always knew you'd do well for yourself, Mark, but this is amazing.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Relax, you don't go to adulterer's prison for drinking tea and playing Connect Four.",Russell's House

4,4,Mark,Sally,"There's not much else he can do in the real world, and I've been very lucky and I like to spread that around.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,Glad I sprayed my nuts with aftershave though. You never know how things might turn out. I'm no Nostradamus.,Russell's House

4,4,Sally,Mark,"Right, you know even I think it's kind of beautiful I suppose.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Yeah, there is something beautiful about the male member. It's good to have a look at it now and again. A reminder of what can happen if you're not careful.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,What am I saying? At least he's going. Don't need a witness to this fiasco.,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Here, Sally, I got you a present. Hitchhiker's Guide, it's the same copy we read from at Sutton Hoo. I got it signed by Douglas Adams when he came to the big WH Smiths.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Oh, this is, it's lovely. Thank you, it's so romantic. It's the perfect way to start our affair.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Our affair? OK, that sounds good. What sort of affair were you thinking of? The Dreyfus Affair or more like the Watergate Affair? 'Cause I can tell you right now I'm not burgling any Democrats.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Relax, we both want it to happen.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, she's gonna kiss me. I'm such a bastard. I'm meant to be getting married. I'm out of my depth. I thought she was a frightened, little suburban mouse. But no, she's my nightmare. A liberated, sexually adventurous urban woman.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, Sally, Look, I'm really not sure I...",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"What am I doing? This isn't me, I can't have an affair. I'm not French. I'm the least French person on the planet. My favourite cheeses are Cheddar and Red Leicester.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Look, no, I'm sorry Sally. I just don't know if I can do this. I mean, you've got your miserable relationship and the truth is I have got one of my own. And I just feel that, you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And even if it is broke, just ignore it and maybe it'll be sort of OK? Like the environment. Who's that?",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,Is Russell back? Oh no!,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,Foz!,Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Shit, he's fucking followed me again. He's obsessed with the idea that I'm screwing around on him.",Russell's House

4,4,Foz,Sally,What the fuck are you doing here? Are you screwing wankathon's mate?,Russell's House

4,4,Foz,Sally,"Come on, we're going.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Wow, he didn't hit me. Bit disappointing. I sort of deserve to be hit.",Russell's House

4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, no, I guess this is a pretty funny story.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"One that I'll never, ever tell anyone because of my deep and burning shame.",Russell's House
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, more data entry tonight. I guess the only good thing is that my life is so boring it feels like it might go on forever. Maybe I'll put on Big Bond Themes and pretend I'm data entering for MI6.",Apollo House

4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Hi Jez.,Flat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"So, listen, you know how depressed you are about getting married?",Flat

4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's in four weeks, Mark. It's going to happen. Look, no matter how unpalatable it may be, the fact is, I'm your best friend. And I know you don't wanna hear it but, I love you. And, in your own dried up, desiccated, weird and unfriendly way, you love me too. So, I've got together my last scraps of cash to give you the stag weekend of your dreams!",Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Really?,Kitchen
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes. I've booked us a canal boat near an Iron Age area, and you can go and look at the Iron Age or whatever it is you do, and I'll make us some steaks. And I've sent off for a chess set and I'll learn how to play but, if I'm not good enough, then there's a computer setting. Or, I'll be pretending to play but really you'll be playing the computer. OK?",Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, well that's nice. That actually sounds fun. Unfortunately, as I said, I think I might not be getting married, after all.",Kitchen
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,Oh?,Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, Sophie's twigged something's ""not right"" and she's arranged for us to see a relationship counsellor.",Kitchen
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, and yet you seem excited because...?",Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Because it's all gonna come out! The whole disgusting mess. She'll wheedle it all out. It'll take hours to break me down but then it'll all spill out and Sophie won't be able to shout at me because there'll be a professional there. And none of it's even my fault! It's all my so-called subconscious.,Kitchen

4,5,Sophie,Counsellor,"Um, well, I just wish I felt that comfortable...",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Hold on, is that it? Is that my go finished? Did she just believe what I said? What kind of counselling is that? She didn't wheedle anything out of me! How am I supposed to blow my emotional beans if she doesn't at least give me a wheedle?",Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,"Plus, obviously, Sophie mentioned on the phone about the sexual problems in your relationship.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,I'm sorry?,Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,The sexual problems in your relationship.,Therapist's

4,5,Mark,Sophie,Right.,Therapist's

4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"So, after we dump the shopping, do you want to go for a little stroll?",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,Just the two of us?,Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,Yeah.,Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,Cool.,Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Well, do you wanna turn this around and I'll see you in a sec?",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, God, I think I love her. I think I'm falling in love. Or getting a bone on, which is basically the same thing when you get rid of all the Valentine's cards and bullshit.",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Others,"Come on, Mummy!",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, pissed and stoned in a gas-guzzler. This is the life. Already given a quid to Greenpeace this year, so I'm golden. Not the dog, not the dog. Shit, the dog!",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, yeah, this is cool. Just don't think about the dead dog. If I don't think about it, there's always a chance it didn't happen.",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Let's roll, cowboy. Where's Mummy?",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,Mummy?,Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Yeah, I let her out for a piss.",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,Are you sure she was with us?,Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Jeremy, she was on the back seat.",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,She must've run off.,Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Except she definitely hasn't, 'cause I'm carrying her round in this bag.",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,She never just runs off.,Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"She is a wild animal, you know. The call of the wild? She might've become leader of a pack of foxes or-",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Jez, it's Mummy. We're not just leaving her.",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Why did I put her in the bag? I should've thrown her, like a discus.",Malcolm's 4x4

4,5,Malcolm,Mark,"Mark, if anything did happen, how quickly could you up sticks, though? Anything tying you down?",Canal Path
4,5,Mark,Mark,Does a marriage count?,Canal Path
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"Nope, not that I can think of. Wherever I lay my hat, pending legal searches, that's my home.",Canal Path
4,5,Malcolm,Mark,"Cool. So, you and Lucy seem pretty sweet on each other.",Canal Path
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"Oh, yeah.",Canal Path
4,5,Malcolm,Mark,What do you think of her? Honestly.,Canal Path
4,5,Mark,Mark,I think she might have a borderline personality disorder.,Canal Path
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,I think she's lovely.,Canal Path
4,5,Malcolm,Mark,"Well, that's nice. I'll tell her that.",Canal Path
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"OK, great.",Canal Path

4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Guess what, Jez?",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Malcolm's head-hunting for a co-manager of his Indian call centre.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, so?",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"There's a chance, a slight but very definite chance, that I could be off to India. And you know what that means. Won't be able to get married.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,No?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Of course not! Sophie couldn't ask me to turn down the opportunity of a lifetime.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,Couldn't she come?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, no, there'd be visa issues, endless complications. No, I'm afraid to say, this could put a great deal of strain on the whole relationship.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Brilliant, well done, mate.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,He's nibbling but he hasn't bitten yet. So I'm just gonna get Gerrard to email through my CV and then wow him with a big pitch.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"So, you'd just go?",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, Jez, don't look like that. You could always come. You could start again, find a new career.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I could be your butler.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"That could work. I'd be the Maharaja, you'd be my white concubine.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I could probably live like a king on a tenner a week. I'd do fuck all. Just lie around smoking dope and then maybe have a bit of a go on the washing up before you got home. I'd probably get a record deal just because I've been to Carnaby Street. I'll be the coolest man in India.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,And maybe we can get one small servant.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Mark,"We'll need a servant. These leftovers are from two nights ago and he never empties the bin. Oh God, I bet it's bursting at the seams with used condoms and porn.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Fuck! Ah! There's a... there's a dead beast in our bin, Jeremy!",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"All right, keep your voice down.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,A dead dog in our bin! How has this happened?,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't know, Mark, but there's no point shouting about it.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, why not? Jeremy, is this... Mummy!?",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, earlier, in the four by four, I had an accident. I mean, the clutch on that thing!",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, right, brilliant. You've killed Mummy. Well, what the hell is it doing in our bin?!",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I had to hid it. Aurora had me looking for it for about four hours. And she made me make posters.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"But, the bin, Jeremy! The bin's for household waste, not beloved pets, et cetera!",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, if I can just get rid of the dog corpse, there's a chance I still might get laid, here.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, right, this is sort of like a disgusting version of The Great Egg Race.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,This doesn't feel great.,Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"It's not great, Jez, that's why.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"There's no chance of it being traced back to us now, though, 'cause it might've been microchipped.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly. No, all things considered, my career prospects, your sexual desperation, this is probably the best thing to do.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,There's a hell of a lot of steam.,Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, as it turns out, dogs do seem to be mostly water.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I mean, it's going a bit, just not the legs.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, put the legs back on in the middle, maybe it'll burn better.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, right! I have to put the legs back on. If you hadn't refused to pay for firelighters, it would've gone by now.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"You shouldn't need firelighters to burn a dog, Jeremy.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"How would you know? Shit, it's going out.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I've got to get my pitch sorted before I see Malcolm.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"We'll have to bury it, get the spade.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,What spade?,Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,You didn't bring a spade?,Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Do you think I'm some kind of freelance dog-murdering mafia man?,Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, great! So we've got no fire, no spade. We'll just have to dig with our hands.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, there are many things I would do to help you, but digging a hole in the wintry earth with my bare hands so that you can bury the corpse of a dog you killed, is not one of them.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I'll just take it to one of those massive council bins. Dump and run, just like my paper boy days. Screw you, Murdoch.",Canal Path

4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Just keep lying till the kissing can start. I mean, it'd have to be a fucking good poster to get that dog back.",Canal Path
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,I might call it a day and head back to the barge. Coming?,Canal Path
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,OK.,Canal Path
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit, gotta dump the evidence.",Canal Path
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you've dropped your bag.",Canal Path

4,5,Lucy,Mark,I like going to the movies.,Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"No, no, not really, no, we were really hungry.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"You have got a bit left, I can see.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"It's really, really badly cooked, we didn't cook it at all well, Mark couldn't be bothered to get firelighters.",Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,It's turkey. It's turkey leg.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Malcolm,Jeremy,Is that all right?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Malcolm,What can I tell you? I'm no Ainsley Harriott.,Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"Nothing, it's just turkey, look. You see? Mmm, just under-cooked, disgusting turkey.",Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I really feel, since I'm eating turkey, you should eat some turkey. It was your idea to barbecue it.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I really don't feel like eating turkey, Jeremy. I'm full.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,I'm eating dog leg. I have definitely reached a new low.,Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Jeremy,Malcolm,It's just a hairy turkey!,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,What's this? Mummy?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,Mummy is probably the turkey's nickname! It could easily be.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Malcolm,They ate Mummy! They burnt Mummy and killed her and ate her!,Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Mark,Mark,Guess not fitting my CV onto one side of A4 is basically irrelevant now.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, probably good things didn't work out with her, she is totally overreacting. It's not like I ate her mum or her dad.",Malcolm's Barge

4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"Of us, of our wedding. Where we got married?",Kitchen

4,6,Jeremy,Mark,That isn't the reason why.,Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, well, can I please just see it?",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, no, 'cause the truth is, there is no speech.",Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, come on, mate. We both know you're not gonna marry Sophie today. It's making you tense, nervous and unhappy. You're gonna stay here with me. I don't make you tense, nervous or unhappy.",Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, you do.",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, come on, not to nearly the same extent. And what's gonna happen to me? I mean, Nancy's going back to America. I mean, am I gonna live here, like, on my own? Who am I gonna go to the pub with? And who's gonna do the forms for, like, the TV and the gas and the water? Me?! Don't you see? None of this works, Mark.",Living Room

4,6,Super Hans,Mark,"Sorry, dude.",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, so I thought I'd start with, ""I will now do my best to give Mark the six most uncomfortable minutes of his life. And the six most uncomfortable minutes of Sophie's life will be coming up later this evening, courtesy of Mark.""",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,I don't like it. I don't like it at all. It sounds like I'm gonna attack her.,Jez's Car

4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Pay? Jeremy, is that from the internet? Are you doing my speech from the internet?",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, that was a ""risqu√© icebreaker"". Would you prefer a ""conservative icebreaker""?",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, that sounds perfect, now can we please get going? I've allowed us a generous four hours to get to the church, but I don't want to eat into our margin of safety by yakking here.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, I'll do conservative icebreaker, met at college material, couple of middle-of-the-road inebriation gags. Bang, I'm out of there.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, good. You know, I actually find it quite comforting that our entire relationship can be reduced to an online speech template. I mean, Kenneth Halliwell and Joe Orton couldn't do that.",Jez's Car
4,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Oh, fuckin' hell.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Is he gonna be OK?,Jez's Car

4,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Got most of it in a shoe.,Jez's Car

4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Don't be ridiculous.,Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,This is you all over. You'd rather get married for the whole of your life than consider that maybe I might be right about something.,Town Centre

4,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh, this is not how I imagined it, scrubbing my puke-stained wedding wear in a coffee shop toilet. Still, none of it's how I imagined it. Just wish I felt a tiny bit excited, not like I was marching to the Gulag for an undetermined crime.",Coffee Shop

4,6,Mark,Mark,"God, what's happening to me? Am I really gonna get married? Don't want to, but calling off the wedding at the last minute? Don't want to hurt lovely Sophie. Need time to think. How can I buy some time? Contract TB? But where from? No badgers. Try to get beaten up? I could say, he's got a fat head. Call him a jizz-cock? Not actually an insult, all cocks are jizz-cocks really. Be like calling him a piss-kidney. Road traffic accident? Yeah, that'd kick everything into touch for a few months. Shit, could I? Here it comes. Come on, Mark, take the hit. Keep your eyes on the prize.",Town Centre
4,6,Driver,Mark,What the hell are you doing?,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Driver,"Sorry, I didn't see you.",Town Centre
4,6,Driver,Mark,You were looking straight at me.,Town Centre

4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You OK?,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, yeah, fine, but bit of a wobble. I just proposed to a woman in a coffee shop and tried to get myself run over.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, right. That is maybe a sign that everything isn't totally groovy.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I think... you're right. I shouldn't marry Sophie, I should call it off.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Brilliant! Let's call this mother off. The El Dude brothers are back! One thing, you have left it pretty late, it will be a jilting.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, no, God, no, no, it's not a jilting. I'm gonna tell her right away. A jilt is at the altar, I'm not jilting.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I think anything on the wedding day is a jilting.,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Nope, at the altar. ""He jilted her at the altar.""",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,But that implies he could have jilted her somewhere else.,Town Centre

4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,Nancy! Hello?,Town Centre
4,6,Nancy,Jeremy,"Hi, Jeremy, I've just had a big bust up with my dad. I wanna come hang out with you at the wedding. Can you pick me up? I'm at the Heathrow Hilton.",Town Centre

4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, let's go. Fuck Super Hans, he'll be fine. Let's leave him.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Do you think we can leave him in that toilet, lying in his various liquids?",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, obviously it's not what either of us would ideally like to do.",Town Centre

4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, it's a short cut.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,That's not possible.,Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"All right, look, we're just making a little detour. Nancy wants to come to the wedding. We'll just nip over to Heathrow...",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Nancy? No Jez, I need to see Sophie.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Just tell her on the phone.,Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, no. Cancelling the wedding on the day is one thing. Doing it over the phone, that's over the line. That's despicable.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I really don't think that's a distinction as big in reality as it is in your mind, Mark.",Jez's Car

4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, you did basically arrange a wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Shit, Jez, I don't think I can do it. I don't think I have a good enough reason to call off this wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I know a reason.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I've got a reason, for you not to marry Sophie. But you have to promise you won't be angry with me.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What is it? Did you get off with her?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, God, something else. But you've got to promise not to be angry.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, I promise. Release the gold.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK. Well, actually, I did get off with her. I snogged her at the JLB conference.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What? You're kidding! You're my best friend and you copped off with my fianc√©e? You lovely bastard! This is dynamite! This is the perfect excuse! Why the hell didn't you tell me about this earlier?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, I thought you might be angry.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I am angry, very angry, but also incredibly relieved. It's difficult to express both emotions at once.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, I am very sorry.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"You're not just saying this? You wouldn't just make this up, would you? To try to keep me happy?",Chapman Homestead

4,6,Mark,Penny,I need to see her immediately.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,Why?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,Something massive has come up.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,Maybe I can sort it out.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,You can't. Let me through.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,What do you want?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,"Sophie was unfaithful. She had an affair, with Jeremy. I need to talk to Sophie about the whole wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Jeremy,You two had an affair?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Penny,"Well, sorry, yeah, we did a bit.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Jeremy,"God, that's-",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Penny,"I mean, not really an actual affair. We had a snog. I mean, these things happen, Penny. We were both very drunk.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Mark, a snog is not an affair.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,"Well, in my eyes, I'm afraid she's been unfaithful. She broke a sacred bond, sort of like a... whore.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Mark, you've come here to talk about the whole wedding because of a drunken snog?",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,It was a breach of trust.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Oh, come on, Mark!",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Jeremy,Did you even use tongues?,Chapman Homestead

4,6,Mark,Penny,Nevertheless-,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Nerves are perfectly natural, but everyone's arriving. It's gonna be a wonderful day. You'll be very happy. But if you really want to go in there and talk to Sophie about calling it off because of a silly drunken snog, then go on, do it.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,See you at the church.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Why couldn't you at least have said you'd fucked her, eh? Would that have been so very hard?",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"How the hell has it come to this? This is wrong, this is terribly wrong.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So, what do you reckon? Are you getting married or not?",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know. I don't wanna end up on my own, like Miss Havisham, wanking into a flannel. But I do feel very strongly that it's not right. There are strong arguments on both sides. It's a moot point. This wedding is moot!",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"It can't be moot, you can't have a moot wedding. You need to decide man. I mean personally I think we should leave a note and get the fuck out.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I just don't know, Jez.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, well, you need to decide 'cause I'm going for a piss.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, this is gonna be horrible. Obviously he's gonna get married, and he'll never let me forget the kiss, and Sophie will never forgive me for telling him. Am I actually going to piss on the church? It'd be quite a statement. Yeah, baby, here I go. Richard Dawkins walks the walk, but he does he actually follow through with an actual act of piss? Oh, shit! Sophie's dad! Didn't even get to bloody wee. Typical, it's all, him, him, him.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Sophie's dad's coming!,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Shit, hide!",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,What? Why?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I need to think. I can't talk to the dad, Jeremy. I'm wrestling with the biggest fucking decision of my life and he's gonna wanna talk about buttonholes and the parking situation, which to be fair, is a bit of a nightmare.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"But what about my piss? I really need to wee, Mark.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Forget it, Jez. Hold it in.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, ""Hold it in"", he says. This is like a Japanese game show. Next he'll put an octopus over my face.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, we're safe up here.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Were you praying just then?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, of course not. I was just kneeling. Having a nice little kneel.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"God, I am dying for a piss. I feel like someone's inflating a balloon full of urine inside me, and not in a good way.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Shit, there's Mum and Dad. Maybe I should, It would still be OK to go down there now, just, wouldn't it? I could say I was looking for God up here. It might not be bad to look like I've gone a tiny bit mad.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Where's Nancy? Why still no lovely Nancy? Oh, fuck! Sophie!",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, my God. There she is. She looks so beautiful. How many missed calls have you got?",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Twenty-eight.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"That's bullshit, I've got seventy-three. Right. Shit, I need to sort this. I mean, what am I gonna do? What's gonna happen here? 'Cause personally, I have no idea.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I really need to get to a urinal, Mark.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Do you know what? I think I might toss a coin. I think tossing a coin might be the best available route open to me right now.,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You are joking?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Why not? I don't seem to have any other ideas. OK so, heads, I marry, lifetime of potential grinding resentment. Tails, I stay here, become a social outcast and turn my back on the woman I may very well love.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I'm excited.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm kind of excited too, so... Urgh, it's marry. I'm gonna marry, shit.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Best of three?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, exactly, best of three. Oh, heads again, shit.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Best of five?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, the coin has spoken.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Great, let's get out of here. I am busting.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, I'm not getting married.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You're over-ruling the coin?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, the coin isn't actually the boss of me, Jeremy. And how I felt when it told me to marry makes me think I definitely shouldn't. So, text everyone, text everyone to tell them that.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,A text?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yup, tell them, tell them I'm doing a Stephen Fry. We're in Brussels. I'm eating chips and mayonnaise. I'm on the edge. You found a blanket under the garage door and I'm wearing an overcoat and no one should approach me. And I'll be back in a couple of weeks and everything's fine. Maybe we'll have a wedding in a couple of weeks. But I'm on the edge, stress that. Everyone needs to be kind to me. Text that.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You want me to send all that to everyone?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,I'll cover the cost.,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, fine, man, but first I can't go on any longer. My bladder, I'm busting.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, is there?",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Let me piss in that prayer bucket.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Prayer bucket? There's no such thing as- that's just a bucket.,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, I'm gonna creep up to the bucket.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, no, no, you can't move.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,What am I gonna do then? I can't hold on.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"If you really can't hold it in, then you'll just have to piss yourself.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You're telling me to piss myself?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, if you've got to go, piss yourself.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Is this what it's come to?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, and do it quietly.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Great and what shall I do after I've pissed myself? Fuck myself? Eat myself? You're such a-,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Are you doing it already?,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, I'm doing it already. I'm so pathetic that as soon as you ordered me to piss myself, I started the procedure. This is what you've done. You've ground down my sense of self-worth over the years. I hope you're proud.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,When are you gonna stop?,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Not for a bit.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Stop, Jeremy. Stop it, it's going down the cracks.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I can't stop!,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Stop!,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, ""piss yourself"", ""stop pissing yourself"", it's not that simple! The floodgates are open!",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,I'm ordering you to stop!,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You're being a real dick about this, aren't you?",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit! Oh, my God! This has gotta be a dream. Nothing this bad could ever happen in reality.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,What am I gonna do? Throw myself off?,Church
4,6,Mark,Others,"Surprise! Hello, it's me. Look, I've surprised you. What a brilliant joke.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Others,"And so, in a sense, Sophie and Mark, here before us, are not just marrying each other, but marrying all of us today. Under God's watchful eye...",Church
4,6,Sophie,Mark,"Are you sure you want to do this, Mark?",Church
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"Of course, of course I want to do this, this is great.",Church
4,6,Sophie,Mark,It's just with the hiding-,Church
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"I wasn't hiding, Sophie. It was a stag thing and it really, really worked. Everyone was so surprised, especially you. Brilliant.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Others,"But first I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh please, someone, save me! Jeremy? Spacemen?",Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,"The vows you are about to take are to be made in the name of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"He's ladling it on now. Is that the proper thing? He hasn't just put that in to needle me, has he? Oh, great, now she's crying and I probably look like a wife beater. It's not fair! I'm unhappy too.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,Will you take Sophie Hortensia Chapman-,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Hortensia? Oh, this is a fucking disaster. Look at me, I'm one of those men women read about in their magazines.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,"...love and protect her, and forsaking all others be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?",Church
4,6,Mark,Vicar,I- I will.,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"That's it, I've ruined it. I've ruined my life. You only get one life and I've ruined mine.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Sophie,...as long as you both shall live?,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,Please don't say I will.,Church
4,6,Sophie,Vicar,I will.,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,Ugh!,Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,Then I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Tears of joy, they're tears of joy. That's the line we both stick to, now and for the rest of our miserable lives.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"So, I've done it, I'm married. If only New Labour hadn't abolished the tax advantages, I'd have something positive to cling on to right now.",Church

4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, it's happened, he's gone. I'm on my own. This is a disaster. I need to take stock. I need to reassess. I need to find someone who can sell me some weed. Where's Nancy? Her lovely face always makes- Oh, fuck!",Church

4,6,Sophie,Mark,"The hump? Our wedding, the hump! Stop the car! I just wanna go and scrub it all out.",Limo

4,6,Jeremy,Others,Drive on!,Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, Nancy, did she not show up?",Limo

5,2,Jeremy,Mark,You have been feeling this for a while.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"But now I'm starting to think that maybe that's good thing. 'Cause now I can get on and do everything I've always wanted to do. Join Mensa, learn the clarinet. I could be a scout leader.",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,Mm-hmm.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"What are you smiling for? Look, scouting is a noble tradition. You do not have to be a paedo to want to work with children, all right?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,But it probably helps.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh God, that is so- I spent five happy years in the scouts and I never once-",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,You told me Kinky Layton was all over you.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, all right, Layton was a bit of a paedo but, not in a bad way, just boosting you over the climbing wall, making you run around the camp in your pants. It was old style paedo-ing, before it got such a bad name.",Living Room
5,2,Mark,Mark,"Of course, Layton only really had eyes for Duncan Carpenter, the doe-eyed little flirt.",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Who's this? And Sophie's dad, angry tweedy father. This is a chain-on scenario.",Flat
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,Hello?,Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"Hi Jeremy, it's Barney, Sophie's cousin. Remember, from the wedding?",Flat
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,Not really.,Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,We went to the car park and we smoked that dope that I bought. That turned out not to be dope.,Flat
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,Oh right. Hi.,Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"We've just dropped Soph off actually, she's going back to work tomorrow.",Flat
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,Is this gonna take long?,Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"Oh, no, no, no. They just wanted me to deliver this to Mark. It's just the tuna from the wedding. It's Mark's half.",Flat
5,2,Ian,Barney,"Come on Barney, let's go.",Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"Anyway, I remembered that you're in a band, and, basically, I've been doing a little bit of my own music. Maybe you could take a listen and tell me what you think?",Flat
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,"OK, well thanks. Good to see you... Barney.",Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,Thanks Jeremy!,Flat
5,2,Mark,Mark,"Mmm, why toast when you can roast?",Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,Another roast? That's the third today.,Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,What's nicer than a roast?,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah but, chain-eating roasts?",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,Who was that?,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,Sophie's dad. And her cousin Barney.,Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,Barney?,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"It's the wedding tuna, your half.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, what? Really? Heartbreak tuna? Oh no, Jez just bin it. I mean not literally, there's no need to be overly dramatic. Freeze it. See how I feel in six months. So they came all this way just for the tuna?",Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"They were dropping Sophie off. She's going back to work tomorrow, so...",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Sophie's going back to work! But that's outside the terms of the treaty! Six weeks! Six weeks till we go back. This isn't six weeks, this is three! Shit, I've got to get in there to stop her lies.",Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,What lies?,Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,That I jilted her at the altar.,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, technically- I mean I'm on your side, but technically that's not a lie.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I did not jilt her, technically I married her.",Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well maybe, but I think what sticks in everyone's memory is the bit where you jilted her.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh shit, if you think that, what's everyone else gonna think? Oh God, I've got to get in there. If she wants a PR war, she can have a PR war. I'll Mandelson her. Nobody wanted New Labour, Jeremy, but now we all know how it works.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Mark,"Walking into the jaws of death. Gotta go past Sophie's desk. What am I gonna say? Please save me, Jesus. I'll believe in you if you save me now. The other way, she's looking the other way! Thank you, Jesus! Although it was 50/50 which way she'd be looking. Might need a bit more to start believing. Oh, the gossip mill, that's right, stare at Hess, throw fruit at Hess, pacing his prison yard. Mmm, piggin' tea break, cup of piggin' tea and work out my piggin' campaign strategy. Oh knickers, here we go, Lisa. She's not saying anything! Brilliant! Good old English reserve.",JLB
5,2,Lisa,Mark,"Um, Mark, I just wanna say, about the wedding and everything. I think you're a real piece of shit.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Lisa,"Oh, OK.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,That's fair. Lisa is a very fair person.,JLB
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,What do you think?,Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"This is raw. Who is this, is this us?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"It's a simple shit-muncher, Sohpie's cousin.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Shit he's done something there, in't he? How'd you do that?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"I think that what's happening is two, or maybe three, different musical things all at the same time.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,This is the kind of thing we should be doing. Complicated shit.,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Only thing is, doing complicated shit like this, wouldn't that be against the big beat manifesto?",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Have you read the big beat manifesto, lately?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,Did we write it down?,Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"The big beat manifesto goes, ""Big beats are the best, get high all the time.""",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,Right. At the time it felt like a much more all-encompassing philosophy.,Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,Can we have this? Can we use it?,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Well, listening to this, it did make me think, lately I've been having some ideas and this is exactly the sort of thing that I was thinking of doing.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,He's nicked your idea?,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Well, has he? That's what I'm wondering. Nicked my idea and then done it back to me.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,I reckon we should invite him down. I think we can teach this kid a thing or two.,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Until he arrives, should we send this out to promoters?",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah, I think this is probably the best example of the sort of stuff we'd do that we've ever had.",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Oh yeah, cause sometimes it's really hard, actually, to do your own ideas.",Living Room
5,2,Mark,Mark,"OK, grab your nuts Corrigan, first contact. There she is, Sophie. Should I go over, forget the spin war? Apologise? Stab myself with a fork? They only have plastic. Oh crying, yes nice. That's going to play very well with the floating voters. Nice tears, Goebbels. Her and her mates will probably start handing out vicious cartoons of me as a rodent in a big top hat and everyone will think it's hilarious until a mob comes round and smashes my shop window. At least I've got off the roast wagon. Oh God, there she goes. This is a public relations nightmare. Where do I sit? This must be what it's like being a nonce in prison.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Hello, is it OK if I go here?",JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,Please don't call me a piece of shit.,JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"Sure, whatever. I'm Debbie but everyone calls me Dobby.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Are you new? I don't think I've seen you here before, have I?",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"I'm the IT misfit, the man with no name. I'm in and out, Kettering, Croydon, Aberdeen.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, right. I'm Mark but you've probably heard of me under some other horrible abusive name.",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"No, why?",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, no, just everyone abuses everyone now, don't they? ""Fuck off"", ""fuck off you wanker."" It's supposed to be funny but of course it's not. Wow, you carry personal cheese. Is that allowed?",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"I'm a smoker, I need man-cheddar, you know?",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,Right.,JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,If you like you could...,JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,"If I was seen sharing cheese with a woman it could be misinterpreted. My approval rating would drop through the floor. Plus, looks like she might gnaw on it.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"I'm fine, I think if I ate anything with any flavour in this room my body would probably spasm due to shock.",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,Right!,JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, by the way, is it possible to easily put a block on a couple of email addresses?",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"Why, what you been getting?",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, nothing, just some crap.",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"You're a piece of shit, shitter. Stuff your bollocks up your gob.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,It's just mates and that.,JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,Fuck off and shut up and die.,JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Yeah, they're pretty funny.",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"Arseholes. OK, Jeff, Lisa, Paul, their emails will go into junk. You can check 'em if you want. Plus I've put an auto-reply offering them to come and sit on your hairy dick. Joke.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,Oh!,JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,"That's a good joke, she's nice, she's being nice. I'm pathetically grateful. Maybe I should ask her out for a drink. She is a floating voter. Plus, she's weirdly attractive. No, don't go there, Clinton.",JLB
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"Oh, wow, this is your room. This is so cool.",Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Think I found someone to do my hoovering.,Jez's Room
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"These your jeans? These your actual jeans? Look, Jeremy, right, this is what I'd look like wearing your jeans. ""Hi, I'm Jeremy, I've got loads of girlfriends and hash. Look at my jeans.""",Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,"Yeah, that is a bit like me.",Jez's Room
5,2,Super Hans,Barney,"Here we go, just typed up a little contract on Professor Yaffle's computer.",Jez's Room
5,2,Barney,Super Hans,A contract?,Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,"Yeah, it's standard procedure for a new band member.",Jez's Room
5,2,Barney,Super Hans,"Right. Um, maybe I should just show that to my dad's solicitor.",Jez's Room
5,2,Super Hans,Barney,No.,Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,"No, no.",Jez's Room
5,2,Super Hans,Barney,Sign it and then we can talk about it later. Before you sign it it's all a lot of waffle.,Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Barney,"Hey. Barney, is it? What are you doing here, what's going on?",Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"It's cool, Barney's just staying over for a bit. He's joined the band.",Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Jez's Room
5,2,Barney,Mark,"Um, actually these guys were just saying they wouldn't mind some cheese McCoy's. Do you want me to get you anything from the shop?",Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Barney,"Ah, no, I think I'm fine, actually.",Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,While you're down there how about some Ribena and a Twirl?,Jez's Room
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"OK, McCoy's, Ribena and a Twirl. I'll go grab my jacket.",Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, he's Sophie's cousin for God's sake! You're sleeping with the enemy.",Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh relax Mark, it's fine.",Jez's Room
5,2,Barney,Mark,"Mark, they want me to sign this contract. What do you think, should I sign it?",Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Barney,Not even sure where you'd sign it. Is that meant to be a dotted line? Who drew this up? A lot of these aren't proper sentences.,Jez's Room
5,2,Super Hans,Mark,"It's legalese, all right? Keep your beak out.",Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Look Mark, we heard today we've got a spot at The Fuck Bunker.",Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,The Fuck Bunker.,Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, and we've got an A&R man coming so we need to have a contract, everything nice and tied down, yeah?",Jez's Room

5,2,Mark,Barney,"Looks good to me, Barney. Go for it, dude.",Jez's Room

5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"He's not sucking you off, is he?",Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"No, of course he isn't.",Jez's Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,Probably would.,Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,You have to be very careful asking someone to get you a Twirl who would also suck you off.,Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Still, blowjob and a Twirl.",Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Mark,"Got the nod, the mark of the human. I'm a human, you're a human, what else is there to say?",JLB

5,2,Dobby,Mark,I'm all right.,JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,"What if someone comes in? Should step away. Step away from the bum. Bit impolite to step away, I don't want to step away.",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,I got some feta today.,JLB

5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Yeah, I believe so. Or goat's.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,"This is possibly the most exciting thing that has happened to anyone ever. Does she know what she's doing? Is she just innocently waggling her bum around and I'm getting illegal benefit? I'm not doing a sexual assault, am I? You can't do a sexual assault if you stay still like a statue. I'm just a statue, a dirty, filthy statue. Oh, God I'm getting very... Captain Corrigan is flying without a license! Oh, Jesus it's too much, I'm gonna blow my beans, I'm gonna do a Chesil Beach! Don't let her know.",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,Are you OK?,JLB

5,2,Dobby,Mark,Bye.,JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,"Uh, did she notice? Should have stayed for at least a snog but for some reason my interest level just dropped straight off. God, it's soggy down there. It's gonna start chafing. Need to clean up, need to get out. Shit, Elaine and Michael. They'll probably wanna talk quarterly sales. Fire exit. Could bust out here and out into the car park?",JLB

5,4,Mark,Jeremy,"You don't have to agree, Jeremy. You're free to turn the money down.",Living Room

5,5,Mark,Cally,"Well, actually one thing did occur. Not wanting to be horrible to Jeremy but Super Hans did seem more like the kind of person you'd expect to see in a band like this.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,He's fuckable.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,I'm sorry?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"It's an industry term. It means someone might want to fuck him. Interesting. Forefront Super Hans, side-line Jeremy.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Oh no, I didn't mean... I just meant...",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"I thought you were a business brain Mark, but you're better than that. You're what my grandma would call a real piece of shit.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,Yeah?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"It's a great plan, Hans is the star. Jeremy is the second stringer. Let's fuck him. That's our dick, that's Jeremy's arsehole. We're fucking him.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Look, Cally. No, we don't have a shared dick.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,Not yet anyway.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,How do you mean?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,Do you want to date? Are you a dater?,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"I have been out with women, so I guess...",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,A friend of mine is doing a little talk over at a hippie shop in Ludlow. Said I might pop in. Wanna come?,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"OK, sure.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Wow, I've got a date. I'm a real piece of shit. I bet those two things go hand in hand. Bet if I got into defrauding pensioners the pussy would really start rolling in.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed I brought you to this. Past life regression? What a load of bullshit.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,"It's fine, it was fun.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,People always say they were like Napoleon or an Aztec princess.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Come on guys, where are all the Chinese peasants? Where are the German toilet cleaners?",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,"God, I can't believe I'm dating someone I really like. I've done it right. I've done it right for once.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Hey, check out the crystal skulls.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,Oh God!,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,I've read loads of books about them.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,She's funny.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"They were probably crafted by the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis, and they're powerful centres of healing.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,Is she still joking?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Oh right, fascinating... theory.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Oh come on Mark, the other stuff, no. But the skulls? How could you possibly make one of these except by some kind of magic?",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,In a factory? From glass?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Oh, sure, come on! Could you make that?",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,No.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,Could anyone?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,Yes.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Look Mark, this is important to me. If we're going anywhere, I need you to tell me you believe in crystal skulls.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,Please don't make me believe in them.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,Do you believe?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,I do believe in crystal skulls.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,And what do you believe about them?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,I believe that they were crafted by the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis and that they're powerful centres of healing.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"There, that wasn't so hard was it?",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,Sorry science. Sorry enlightenment. Sorry logic.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,Well that was great. Apart from the crystal skull sending out it's invisible rays of bullshit. I think that might be my best ever sexual experience.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"OK, I think we have to have a talk, about the whole thing.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,"I'm sorry, the whole...",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"The whole sexual experience. I have to say, that was very disappointing.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Oh, right.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"I don't mean to be rude, but is that the kind of thing you usually do?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Well I suppose in general- what exactly did I do wrong?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Well it was better than with Jeremy though. With Jeremy, I had to stop him in the middle.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,You stopped Jeremy in the middle?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Sorry, is this weird for you? Do you want to know?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,"I do, a bit.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,He's like a red setter bounding after a tennis ball. You're like a captain solemnly going down with his ship.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Oh well that's good to know.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,But we can try again. As long as you're prepared for me to tell you exactly what to do.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,That could be a good system.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"OK now, I'm going to take your hand and put it there. You OK with that?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Yeah.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Now, I want you to move your hand around like this this. You can do that, right? It's easy.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Not a problem.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,Is this humiliating? It is a bit humiliating. I guess the upside is that what I was doing before was humiliating in a way I wasn't even aware of.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,OK good. Lets begin the sex. I'll drive.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, this is brilliant. I'm a sex robot servicing the one. I always wondered what my fetish was and it seems what truly turns me on is being basically absent for most of the sex act.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Look at them all, the Christians. It's not fair, I could be that happy if I believed a lot of rubbish.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"So listen, Hans and I have had a big chat, and we're really into your idea.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,What idea?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,Getting rid of Jeremy.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,That wasn't... my idea was more throw a bit more light on Hans and maybe give Jez a tambourine.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Look, imagine you have a chocolate bar and half of it was made of delicious milk chocolate, and the other half was made of human shit. Wouldn't you just break off the half made of shit?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,I really don't think that's a fair analogy.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Is that Jeremy? Is he getting baptised? I can't let him out of my sight for a minute.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Damn, the contract. The Chemicals have read the appendix. I need to get on this, I've got to get back. Look, would you do me a huge one and tell Jeremy he's not playing tonight?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"What? Oh, no, no, it's not my job. You're the manager. I'm just the roadie.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"It'll be better coming from you. You'll say better lies about him not being terrible. Plus, real world, I might not make the gig. Pick you up at five.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Oh God I'm the messenger. Somebody please shoot the messenger.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey Mark, I just got baptised. This is Ronnie, he was my baptiser.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Others,Thanks Ronnie.,Festival
5,5,Others,Jeremy,Peace be with you Jeremy.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Others,"Yeah, peace be with you too Ronnie.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah the organisers were pretty keen for me to get it done before the show. Initially, I was a bit iffy. But then I thought, you know, gig in front of hundreds of people. Fuck it. Plus, there's like maybe a one percent chance that the whole Jesus thing could be true - sorry Ronnie - in which case, I got something to pull out of the bag on judgement day.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, right.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Just walk him into the car park and shoot him in the back of the head. I'm Tony Soprano, he's an FBI stripper.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"You know what? I'm really looking forward to the gig tonight after all. If Super Hans is into it, then I'm into it. Everything's finally coming together, and everything's finally definitely going to be OK.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh God, he's on a raft floating towards Niagra Falls flicking through Heat magazine with one hand down his trousers. I've got to tell him.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Look Jez. There's something I need to tell you. It's not good news. Cally told me, she and Super Hans, they want... you're out of the band.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Me, out of the band? What the fuck?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Might slip this one under the rug while he's still reeling.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, because we're going out and she told me she's had this idea. And I said ""no, don't"". That's literally what I said.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"You're screwing Cally? I'm out of the band? They can't just do this to me, can they?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Seemed to get away from the Cally thing.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, you'll have to break up with her.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,What? No Jez.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She's trying to shaft me Mark. You've got to dump her, it's a no-brainer.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"It is not a no-brainer. I'll have to think about it. It's a brainer. It's a real brainer. See the thing is, I don't think I've ever done sex right before.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, you're fine mate. Just stick with missionary. You're a sexual civilian. Leave the disgusting stuff to me.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,Cally's teaching me. She gives me second-by-second detailed instructions of what to put where for how long.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"That's cheating. Anyone can please a woman if she tells you what to do. You're not allowed to ask, that's the whole point.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, if I break up with her, I don't see myself having good sex ever again. Unless I'm like, going on holiday to Hawaii and the plane crashes, and all my fellow survivors are women sex therapists on their way to a conference. And even then, they'll probably be loads of male sex therapists there too and they'd love that, wouldn't they? All fucking each other and giving each other tips while I sit on a rock wanking and crying.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, all right man. Whatever. Lets talk to Hans. If we can get him on side, then maybe you can keep your pathetic nookie lessons going. So, did Cally tell you about her and me, much?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"No. God no. Don't worry, nothing like that.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"She stopped him in the middle. I'll save that for a rainy day, that's money in the bank.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Right, what the fuck's going on? Where's Cally? Why have you got drugs?",Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,Well Cally came through with a bit of herb that Christos keep on the down low. Bishop weed.,Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Cally told Mark I'm out of the band. What the hell's going on?,Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"It's a disgrace. I'm cut up about it. I told Cally, I said for me, this is almost a resigning matter.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Right, so are you going to walk?",Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Almost did mate. Almost fucking did. I kicked off big time. But then I thought, maybe I can work from the inside. No point in both of us getting kicked out of the band.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,But we are the band.,Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Look, all I'm hearing is that you're out of the band. That's what everyone's saying. That's all I'm hearing. Jez is out of the band.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Now you're saying it.,Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"I'm quoting. Look man, I'm really gutted, but me and Tara want to kick back with a bit of Barchester. So maybe you should fuck off.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Right. If that's the way it is, fine. Can I take a bit of drugs?",Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Love to mate, love to. But this is all mine and I want it all. So, gotta be a no.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Fucking hell.,Band Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Maybe it's for the best though, Jez. Maybe solo, you can do all the things you've always wanted. That rap thing with Howard Marks.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I've got to talk to Cally. Talk her round. You can be my spin doctor. Tell her why I'm brilliant, why I'm so essential to the band.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, sure. Just remind me again why you are so brilliant? I mean I know why, but it's good to have soundbites.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,Cally? Cally?,Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"No Jeremy, you can't just...",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Shit. He's entering the chamber. The sacred chamber of satisfactory sex.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, let's just go. Or you can leave her a very frank note.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Or, we could piss on something.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,No Jez.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes Mark. Come on, it's all fucked. This is rock 'n' roll. She screwed me over and now it's her turn. Let's fuck this place up! We're the hammer of the gods!",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, take that teabag tin.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, no.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She smashed my dreams, let's smash her caravan. Come on.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"I could make the best of it, go for a freebie on the skull. He'll get the blame, I'll bank mate points. I'm golden. Haha, unlucky pal. I win.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Ow, fuck!",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,The revenge of Atlantis.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, this feels good. This just feels so right, you know?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, how long are you going to keep going with the orgy of destruction? Because I'd rather not be here when she turns up.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah man, no. You go. I'm gonna stay. I wanna see the look on her face. Ha ha, no one screws with the Jez man.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Hope she's not too upset. Fuck it, if it's healing powers are so legendary, it can fix itself.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Christian security? What's he gonna do, excommunicate me? Yeah, this is going to be good. Rub her double crossing face in it.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"Jez, I've been looking for you everywhere.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,I'm sure you have.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"I got a call from Super Hans, he's having an ego attack. He's driving to Festivus with all the windows down shouting his own name. Reckons he's gonna make a super group out of Hard-Fi and Kaiser Chiefs.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,He's talked about that before.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"So the thing is, do you want to play the gig, solo?",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Well, yes.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"Brilliant. So, let's talk set lists.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"But, there's something you should know.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,Am I actually gonna do this?,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Mark, he went mental.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,Oh my God.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,It's a mess.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,What the hell happened?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Yeah, this is classic Mark I'm afraid. He does this sort of thing the whole time. He's passive aggressive. He won't say anything, he just smashes.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"But my skull, my crystal skull!",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Yeah, he hates the skulls. He smashed it and then cut his hand in a kind of... mad fury.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"God, how could he?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Well, he hates being told what to do in bed. He hates you for pushing me out of the band. I was like ""dude, these things happen"". But he was like ""Noooooo"". That's when he did the eggs.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,Really?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,Yup. He's weird. Twisted. Vindictive. He draws horrible cartoons of you and then wraps them up in sausage meat and calls you a sausage-muncher.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,Jeez.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"On the bright side, he wanted to shit on the sofa, but I managed to stop him.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,First proper gig. Dicked over Mark but that's fine. This is worth it. He's what it's all about. He's having a great time.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Ah, there she is. Leaving with the one. Not a bad weekend, all told. Got myself a girlfriend, had the best sex of my life. Did my bit to delay the dawning of the Age of Aquarius with my trusty friend the house brick.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"She's giving me the finger. The one is giving me the finger. Ah yes, that's more like it. The one is gone. The familiar gut punch of pain and confusion is back. Hello old friend.",Festival
5,6,Mark,Mark,"What an amazing day. Promotion. Finally, all the backbiting and plotting and arse-kissing and credit-stealing and hard work has paid off. Goodbye, Mark Corrigan, credit manager. Hello, Mark Corrigan, senior credit manager. I've smashed the glass ceiling with my greasy pole!",Flat

5,6,Mark,Sophie,"Well, thanks. See you soon.",Flat
5,6,Mark,Mark,"Is that it? No sarcastic put down, no casual kick in the balls? Maybe it's because she's been smoking drugs. Good old drugs.",Flat
5,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Hi, Jez.",Living Room
5,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, hi, Mark.",Living Room

5,6,Mark,Mark,"Ouch, the ghost at the feast. Better take the mustard off.",Living Room

5,6,Jeremy,Mark,I've just been doing a lot of thinking lately.,Living Room
5,6,Mark,Mark,Oh shit.,Living Room

5,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, what? No. No, no, no.",Living Room
5,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Maybe I'm not in the one percent of people who think they're gonna be successful musicians and are totally right, but in the ninety-nine percent of talentless, misguided dickheads.",Living Room

6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"There's a script? So I'll be, like, an actor?",JLB
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly, Jeremy, you'll be just like an actor, like Al Pacino or Jeremy Irons. Just tell everyone you call up ""hello, you've been specially selected as eligible for our exclusive introductory interest rate.""",JLB

6,1,Jeremy,Mark,The moustache?,Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, I'm having a mini wobble on the moustache. What do you think? I just feel, I'm not trying to associate JLB HQ with the Nazis, that would be reductive. I just want to hint at certain similarities in terms of the unquestioning approach both power structures want their underlings to adopt. Do you think people will get that?",Pub

6,1,Mark,Steffan,I'm really sorry about the moustache.,Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"No, no, it's fine, it's uh, a difficult time.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,"To me, Germany is Goethe and Thomas Mann and Boris Becker, but it's, it's difficult to do a Goethe moustache. Did Goethe have a moustache, out of interest?",Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"I don't know, um, I don't think so. Maybe.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,"Really, that's fascinating. I'd like to talk with you more about Goethe.",Pub

6,1,Steffan,Mark,We don't like friction.,Pub
6,1,Johnson,Mark,"Their thing is, if the campaign were to quieten down, maybe there'd be a few more resources for redundancy. You might even get your bonus.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Johnson,They're gonna give us what we want?,Pub
6,1,Johnson,Mark,"No, but they can give you what you want.",Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"On a one-off basis, if all this unpleasantness was to go away.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"They want to stuff my mouth with gold, lovely, chewy gold. I could pay off the sofa, I could buy the matching chair.",Pub
6,1,Johnson,Mark,"I told Steffan you might not have the arsehole for this, Mark. You need a brass ringpiece to handle this. The question is, can you put a lid on the squid?",Pub

It's been a great afternoon and we've had a lot of laughs, and I'd just like to say about the JLB survivors' group, and the final salary payout battle, well, it's been a week now, and I think the time has come for us to stand up and say, we tried, we failed, and we're moving on.",Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,What do you mean?,Pub
6,1,Mark,Others,"Look, JLB is a big multinational and it's served us all a great big shit sandwich, but what we've got to do is we've just got to eat it down. So let's go forward, conserve our energy, let bygones be bygones, turn the music up, and have a great time! Over to you, Mr. DJ!",Pub

6,1,Gerrard,Mark,What about our money?,Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, when are we gonna get our money?",Pub

6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Twenty-nine degrees, are you insane?",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,I don't actually want it to be wenty-nine. But you've got to give it something to aim for. It'll get hotter quicker.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"No, it won't. It's either on on off. You set it, it achieves the correct temperature, it switches off.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, sure. You set it to twenty-three, it'll be pootering along, ""Oh, yeah, twenty-three? Easy, yeah, nearly there."" Wouldn't you rather, ""Fuck, twenty-nine!

6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know why you're sweating it, dude. You should just ask her out, like I did with Dobby.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, just because today was the first time you have ever, ever, ever, successfully arranged a date with a woman does not suddenly make you Alfie, OK.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Mark,He's never dated. He just ruts like a hog.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Sophie, can I just say... I know it's a heavy time for all of us, and we all need to unwind, but... dope plus baby, doesn't that equal career in the Argos stockroom?",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Mark,"It's for my brother, Mark.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, right. Sorry.",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Mark,"Anyway, the reason I wanted to see you both, and I hope you're gonna be OK with this, but I think I want a paternity test before the birth so we know. Are you OK with that?",Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Really hope it doesn't involve anything going up my knob.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,A paternity test? I guess it would be interesting to know.,Living Room

6,2,Mark,Mark,Oh God. Wanking into a cup. The dream.,Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Yeah, um, here's the thing. It's against my moral philosophy to put anything up my knob. That's just a line I will not cross.",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,This is to swab inside your cheek.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Of course. Now, that's much more civilised.",Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Yeah, OK, I'm really not sure about this.",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,Why?,Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"I just don't want my bar code on the database. I mean, the truth is, I have banged a lot of chicks. I mean, that's just a matter of historical record.

6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"Well, there is a third possibility.",Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,It might not be a boy or a girl? It could be something else?,Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"No. Look, I was in a bit of a state, and I had a drunken thing at the same time as you, two, with Jeff.",Living Room

6,2,Mark,Sophie,You did it with Jeff?!,Living Room

6,2,Mark,Mark,How did he get to be the grown up? I paid for the dips.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah sure, OK, I agree, and can I just point out the wide selection of dips.",Living Room

6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Would you like to come in for some lunch?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Er, yes, please. I'm a vegetarian but I eat chicken and fish and posh bacon so-",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"No, sorry, lunch is my code word, for drugs.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, right. Right.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I'm in, she'll never get rid of me now.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Lucky you caught me. I was just going out to check out DILFs in the park.,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, are they in flower already? I love nature-",Elena's Flat

6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"She said fuck. If I say fuck, maybe we'll fuck.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Yeah, I'm not much of a dealer. As you probably have noticed. It's just a friend left the country in a hurry, and left me a kilo of grass.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh God, she's so beautiful. My head's gone blank. Come on Jez, restart, reboot, vibe up. Heart racing, hands shaky.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"That's just, er, I get like that when I hadn't had a smoke for a while. I'm not a junkie. I'm just excited. I just love drugs!",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Where's my vibe? Got to make a connection. Compliment?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Hmm. Can I just say, great temperature.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Sorry?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"I was just saying, you got a great temperature in here. What are you on, out of interest?",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Um, I don't know.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,Mind if I...?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Sure.,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,Twenty-three. Nice.,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Man, she has got one sweet temperature.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Ugh, I hate this boiler. It's too hot. I can't date under these conditions.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"It's a great boiler. It's just got a very idiosyncratic control panel. It's like the Jesus and Mary Chain of central heating control systems. Hard to get into initially, but then, so much to explore.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Does Elena have to come over tonight?,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, yes she does. I've been to hers twice a day all week. I can't buy any more weed, it's killing me.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Can't you go to the cinema or something? I don't want to date on top of you.,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"But it's not a date, that's the whole point. She's just coming upstairs for a smoke. It's simply two very casual people who happen to have perfectly matching genitals.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Try and give me and Dobby some space. I need space to operate.,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Not a problem, kemosabe. We'll be in my room. Slipping effortlessly from getting high off her own supply to...",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,What is that?,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,Sexy time.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, making love from behind and them slapping the woman on the arse. Since when did that become the international sign of a mutually loving sexual experience?",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,We'll probably do that for a bit and then graduate to some back door action.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Why do you insist on seeing the anus as some kind of human USB port, just waiting to have all kinds of hardware plugged into it.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh my God, what is he wearing? He thinks when you're on a date you should look like Des Lynam.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Turn down! Turn down! Obey my commands, Orac! This manual is balls. Can you turn it down? It's on twenty-three, and ideally I want it no higher than seventeen.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, women are coming. We want to make the women hot.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"No, you want it cold so they have to cuddle up to for warmth. Plus, frugality is very attractive in a man. God, Dobby.",Hall
6,2,Others,Mark,Is it cool to get some lunch?,Hall
6,2,Mark,Others,What are you talking about? It's 7:30. What do you mean?,Hall
6,2,Others,Mark,We're here to see Jez... for some lunch.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, there's some children here who want to have lunch with you.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Others,"Yep, cool, cheers.",Hall
6,2,Others,Jeremy,Cheers.,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"What? Look, I've just bought her so much, I gotta offload it somewhere. Just because I'm dealing a little bit of drugs does not make me a drug dealer.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, yes it does.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, God. Come Mister Taliban, tally my bananas!",Hall
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"So this is cool. Nice to get to know the neighbours. I said hello to one guy in the hall, but he was like really old.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"There's an old women as well, have you seen her?",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Hmmm, got to get off the neighbourhood watch.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"So, tell me Elena. What do you, like, do?",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"I'm working part time as a legal secretary. Human rights law, asylum seekers, torture victims, all that jazz. But, my real passion is music.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, that is so great.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, God, she's perfect. A musician who devotes herself in helping losers.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"I'm like grade eight violin, and a bit of piano.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"That's just so cool 'cause um, I'm a musician too.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,What's your main instrument?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Shit.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"I dabble, you know. I toot, I strum, I bongo.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Oh, I love drums. Play me something.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Er, that's that's not a bongo, that's just a small table in the shape of a bongo.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Oh, so when you're not bongo-ing, do you, like, work?",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Danger.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Er, I was a male nurse for a while.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Why did you stop?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Disgust at having to help people in need.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,The white coats couldn't handle my whole Patch Adams approach. I believe a person should be treated as a human being not a mere set of steel pipes.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, come on. I gotta think of something impressive. What the hell have I been doing all these years? Could be a dad she'd like to fuck? Only thing I've got in the locker.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"And of course, the big news is actually that I'm, er, I'm going to be having a kid.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Are you in a relationship?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, a million times no. No, she's a friend. And she was desperate, and so I was all like, yeah, I'm a very strong feminist, so I believe women should have whatever mad thing they want.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,That's so cute. 'Cause I often think that children are our future.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Yeah! And also, I'm just really into the whole man, baby thing. You know, teaching them to tie things to other things, and you know, holding a baby in the palm of my hand whilst making an espresso. You know?",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yeah. Russian men are all probably infertile. Thanks, Chernobyl.",Jez's Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Oh look, he's hit it. Do you think it'll go in the hole?",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,"Yeah. Novelty golf date beats ironic sci-fi fun, Gerrard. Hard cheese. And we've already had four whiskys, so time for me to roll in my militarised divisions. Makes it much less scary if I think about it like a war.",Living Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Mark, are you about to lunge? Is this pre-lunge?",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,"Sorry, should I have filled out a lunging application form and had it ratified by the FSA?",Living Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Look, don't get me wrong, I like you, but maybe lets not do anything tonight? And when the dust's settled with Gerrard and my other dates, we'll see?",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,"OK, that's fine.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh, my God, she likes me. She just said it, that's undeniable. I can bank that. I can put it on a blog so it's a matter of public record.",Living Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Oh, my God, this guy doesn't know a nine iron from a pitching wedge.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,Exactly.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, we are Roosevelt and Stalin. Gerrard's Churchill. He thinks he's in there, but when the fucking starts and Europe gets carved up, Churchill has to leave. Oh, shit. No, Soph. Cancel, I'm cancelling you out of shame. Like my subscription to White Dwarf.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,"Just, the bank.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,The sperm bank. Where I bank my stupid sperm.,Living Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,And my other passion is poetry.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, wow, really, 'cause er, I dabble.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Oh.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Sure, I dabble. Like da Vinci dabbled in art.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Fuck you, Bush. That sounds good.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Yeah, I wrote that some time ago, but it's still pretty savage.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Go on.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Really? OK. ""Fuck you, Bush. Fuck you, Bush! It's time to get out of Iraq, Bush. What were you even doing there in the first place, Bush? You didn't even get properly elected, Bush. Are you happy now, Bush? Fuck you, Bush!""",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Wow. I love the way the last line is the same as the first line.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Thanks, I did that on purpose.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,Hello?,Jez's Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"Hi, Jez, it's me, Soph. The test result's come through.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Oh, has it? That's marvellous. Marvellous news. Er, excellent, OK then-",Jez's Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"Yeah, so it seems weird to do it on the phone, but I wanted to tell you right away.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Yeah, obviously. Great, great.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Mark or Jeff. Jeff, please Jeff, or Mark.",Jez's Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"I couldn't get through to him, but I'd thought he'd want to know right away. It's Mark's.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Yes! Well that's great news. Thanks for that. Yes, yes, yes, yes!",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Who was that?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"That was, er, Sophie. The mother of the- my baby.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,It's cute how excited you are about it. What was the news?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"The news, the wonderful news, is that everything's OK. And it was just so great to hear that. I like daily updates. That's what I'm like.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Wow. That's so cool.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,Yeah. A human life. Another human life. And it's my responsibility. Forever.,Jez's Room
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Um, hi, sorry to interrupt, but I wondered if you could have a word with Hal and turn the heating down. What's going on?",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Mark,He's just so happy about his baby!,Jez's Room
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Your baby?,Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Mark,He just talked to Sophie.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,Can we talk about this later?,Jez's Room

6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"It's really weird, Jeremy.",Kitchen
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Wow, how did this happen? OK, the truth is I lied. I said I was having a baby because I wanted to impress you.

6,3,Mark,Sophie,"Not sure, let it be a surprise?",Cafe
6,3,Mark,Mark,"Of course it'll be a boy, and he'll be just like me. It'll be like going through it all again.

Although, obviously, the tune will be different in eleven years' time.",Cafe

6,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Nah, this is all voluntary. My job is being in love with Elena. And it's a great job. And she's almost definitely in love with me now, after I took the wank bullet.",Living Room
6,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, didn't you feel at all embarrassed telling a total stranger that you were some kind of extremist masturbator?",Living Room
6,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I did feel a bit humiliated and awful. But it's worth it for Elena. Oh, and I saw the porn she was looking at. Man, it's hot. I mean, she's got great taste. It's the most fantastic porn I've ever seen.",Living Room
6,3,Mark,Jeremy,Isn't it the usual dead-eyed men fucking dead-eyed women in a desperate world of pain?,Living Room

6,3,Mark,Dobby,An incorrect Sherlock Holmes pipe.,Kitchen
6,3,Dobby,Mark,"Mark, are you actually Sherlock Holmes?",Kitchen
6,3,Mark,Dobby,"No, look, I'll think about the pipe. But I just don't want to dilute the content too much. You need a USP, and that's mine. No frills, no wigs, no spin, just telling it like it was.",Kitchen

6,3,Jeremy,Mark,Balls again?,Living Room

6,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Always wipe, Mark. ""Discharge your pipe, then have a wipe."" That's the rhyme.",Living Room

6,3,Jeremy,Mark,No.,Living Room
6,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, come on, Jez. It's going really well again with Dobby. I don't need this. And, Christ, if Jan finds out I'm dead, tidy hair or no tidy hair. I just want you to take a wank bullet for me.",Living Room
6,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't want to take another wank bullet. What am I, some kind of wank shield?",Living Room
6,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh right, I see. So you'll take a wank bullet for Elena, but you won't for me. Ten minutes with her is worth more than ten years with me. Well. I think we can count our friendship pretty much over from now on.",Living Room

6,3,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, you... you've found those.",Outside

6,3,Mark,Dobby,"I know, I'm- I'm really sorry.",Outside
6,3,Dobby,Mark,"Look, you're a man. Men like to look at troubling images of heroin addicts showing their genitals for money. That's hard-wired, like spatial awareness. I mean, it is disgusting and shameful, but, you know, so's the textile industry.",Outside
6,3,Mark,Dobby,Right. Thanks.,Outside

6,3,Tourist,Mark,So he didn't kill anyone near here?,Outside
6,3,Mark,Tourist,"Yes, yes, he did. You're right, he did. Just over there, just outside Jessops, the camera shop. You'd have thought they'd have got a picture, wouldn't you? I'm sorry but have you even paid?",Outside

6,3,Mark,Jan,Was there?,Outside
6,3,Jan,Mark,"Yes. I had a look at it. I'm sorry, but it was an application from you for a full-time job with a loss adjusters? And I just wanted to make sure that you would actually be available to work for us?",Outside
6,3,Mark,Jan,"Yes, I'd, I'd absolutely be available, Jan. The loss adjusters application was just insurance. If you'll pardon the pun.",Outside

6,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Shit, then shitter, but then good.",Outside
6,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Great. I was feeling a bit guilty about not coming. You know I think I've been taking Mark a bit for granted since I started seeing Elena.

6,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Uh huh, that's right.",Kitchen
6,4,Mark,Mark,Should I tell him? Really don't want to. Is that because I don't want to see a friend hurt? Or can't be arsed with the massive hassle?,Kitchen

6,4,Mark,Jeremy,Uh huh. Maybe.,Kitchen

6,5,Mark,Ian,The decent thing?,Kitchen
6,5,Ian,Mark,"There's still a remnant of feeling between you. I could make life quite comfortable for you. Give you a job at the seed firm, light duties. You'll do all right on 40K. Living in Nana's cottage with your wife and child.",Kitchen
6,5,Sarah,Ian,Is this an offer your client is on board for?,Kitchen
6,5,Ian,Sarah,"Oh, I think I can persuade Sophie to take this seriously.",Kitchen
6,5,Mark,Mark,"Maybe I'd be happy. Driving the seed van around with my country cottage and my family. Reading the Sunday Times. It's so thick I could not talk to anyone all day Sunday.

7,2,Gerrard,Mark,What say you to a coin toss?,Pub
7,2,Mark,Gerrard,Why not?,Pub

7,2,Mark,Jeremy,Never stops?,Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"He's got me by the Blackberries. Turning it off is a sackable offense. If I go to a funeral, I can switch it to vibrate.",Mark's Room

7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Plus, it turns out the website, you know it's really mainly about the merch.",Mark's Room
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,Merch?,Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Merchandise. Ben says ""I'm all about the merch. Cut me and I bleed merch."" I can't believe I had him at my mercy in the hospital and I let him go. If I'd known he was such as arsehole, I'd have at least given his tube a little waggle.",Mark's Room
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, murdering your enemies is quite a simple solution. Which I guess is why in ethics and law it's so frowned-upon.",Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"He wasn't even there. It was just me and the servers. After a while, I started to pretend that I was a robot. And, then, I sort of couldn't remember whether I was a robot or not, so I had to get out of there. Anyway, I nicked you some manilla envelopes. 'Cause I know you like to stockpile them and- ooh, Mark is that OK? By the shredder? Can babies go by shredders?",Mark's Room
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, of course. Safest place for him. Stable temperature, plus if there was an earth tremor, Which, obviously, there isn't going to be, he's got added protection.",Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,Awww.,Mark's Room
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I've got him for the day. It's amazing, the bond. Earlier, I was changing him and he pissed all over me. No ill feeling, nothing.",Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Wow, 'cause you... you're pretty uptight. I mean, you hate people pissing on you.",Mark's Room
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly, plus if you went for him now, I'd stab you.",Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Great, that's nice.",Mark's Room

7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah all right, I get the picture.",Mark's Room

7,2,Jeremy,Mark,Great. Tea?,Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Course he's happier with the kit. I bet he wishes the baby was a mortar round.,Mark's Room

7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Uh, no we do.",Mark's Room

7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, relax.",Mark's Room
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"This is Sophie's milk, isn't it?",Mark's Room

7,2,Mark,Jeremy,Jeremy this- it's- it's one step away from cannibalism!,Mark's Room

7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, it bloody well is.",Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, suit yourself. Mmmmm, luxury milk.",Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Sweet. Just texted Ben. Said I had to go to a funeral. Plus, I've got the squits and you're locked in the bathroom having a breakdown. I threw a lot of shit at the wall, see what sticks.",Jez's Car

7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, exactly Jez, thank you. He, oh my God he's- that's my idea! He's using my idea!",Jez's Car
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,You taught him the palm? But I told you the palm!,Jez's Car

7,2,Jeremy,Ben,...that's the whole story.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,I'm going in. Tony B. Liar can disregard the U.N. but he can't disregard the Dobby Club.,Jez's Car

7,2,Gerrard,Mark,"Look, nothing's going on, all right? We're just having a drink.",Pub Garden
7,2,Mark,Gerrard,"I think you're doing a little more than that. No doubt once you've finished these, and she sufficiently high on E numbers, you'll try and supply her with another pork product whose name I don't think needs to be said out loud.",Pub Garden
7,2,Gerrard,Mark,"I'm sorry, Mark, OK? I saw a window of opportunity and I went for it. You would have done the same.",Pub Garden

7,2,Mark,Gerrard,I shall be completing the HMS Victory without your assistance.,Pub Garden
7,2,Gerrard,Mark,You can't handle the rigging on your own.,Pub Garden
7,2,Mark,Gerrard,You had your chance to help me with that rigging. And you blew it.,Pub Garden
7,2,Jeremy,Ben,"Yeah, yeah I'm hoping people might affectionately call them ""The Homunculi"". I'm gonna sign them tomorrow night after the gig. No, no need for you to come, dude.

7,2,Dobby,Mark,Mark? What the fuck?,Jez's Car

7,2,Mark,Dobby,"A bit, but also you needn't give it a second thought. The squits.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,No further details required.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,May I?,Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,"So, you just happened to be in Epsom?",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Yeah but I was in the car, I'm on standby.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,Standby?,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"As Gerrard's replacement. It's cool, we look out for one another. Like me and Jez, he's right over there, so if, God forbid, something should happen, he'll be there to replace me.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,"I have to say, I'm mildly freaking my noggin right now.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Look, Dobby the truth is, me and Gerrard, we have a a sort of a club about you.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,A club?,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"It's not a real club, there's no clubhouse and there's only two of us. It's more of a shared passion, if you will. It's quite sophisticated. Like the Sunday Times wine club. But it's ironic too, so...",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,"Hmm, not nailing this.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,So Gerrard's not ill then.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"No more than usual, he agreed to step aside. Abort your date and let me have a pop.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,A pop?,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Not a pop, a go, a turn.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,Really not nailing this at all.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Others,"Excuse me. Hello, how are you? Hungry? Or another one of your dirty protests? Oh, no you're good, just a blanket.",Jez's Car

7,2,Mark,Mark,Total emperor's new clothes. They smell of baby soap and very faintly of urine.,Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,Mmmmm.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,"Nice. The ultimate aphrodisiac, my son's like a huge oyster.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Look, the truth is, I came out here because I was insane with jealousy and if that's freaky than ill just go. But, the thing about driving for miles to spy on someone is that, if nothing else, it does sort of prove that you have quite strong feelings.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,Yeah? Me and Kerry once hitched a Carlisle just because they had this wicked big Halfords.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Look, if there's nothing happening with you and Gerrard, does that actually mean that there's a... position vacant? As your boyfriend?",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,"What an incredibly off-putting way of putting it. If I say yes, will you stop saying things which are turning my stomach?",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh my god, I've won. I'm resigning from the FDR/Cyberman conflict.",Jez's Car

7,2,Zahra,Jeremy,"Yeah but you told me you're a poet and then you couldn't find your exercise books so... wow, Jez, I love musicians.",Pub
7,2,Jeremy,Zahra,"Well I'm a musician, so I guess you must love me!",Pub
7,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Is that a joke? Or just a genuine wish with me laughing at the end?,Pub
7,2,Ben,Jeremy,"Hey, Jez.",Pub
7,2,Jeremy,Ben,"Great, Mr. Ben. The Homunculi welcome you.",Pub
7,2,Ben,Zahra,"We need to talk business, babe. Get yourself a drink, mine's a large one, as you fucking know! Ha ha ha ha ha.",Pub
7,2,Jeremy,Ben,"So uh, I just wanted to flag out with you about the band. I'm going to taking on a much more hands-on role than your traditional exec. In fact...",Pub

7,3,Mark,Jeremy,You're gonna read a book? You hate reading.,Hall
7,3,Jeremy,Mark,"No, I don't! I love reading. I read Mr. Nice four times. I read The Bunny Suicides. Look, I've offered to host Zahra's book group, OK? And now shitty Ben's decided he's coming because it's happening here and he's all jealous and suspicious. So what I thought was, even though I can't tell Ben to fuck off, I can defeat him mentally at the book group and impress Zahra by saying clever things. So I'm going to read all of this book from page one to... oh shit, three hundred and seventy-two?!",Hall
7,3,Mark,Jeremy,How's the book going? Enjoying it?,Living Room
7,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I look at it, I read the words, or think I do, but then I get distracted or I don't quite take it in and I have to go back. I've been on the same four pages for three hours.",Living Room

7,3,Mark,Mark,Fascinating. It's like watching a sheep try to use an iPhone.,Living Room
7,3,Jeremy,Mark,Oh it's too difficult! I mean the story's told by a man and then a lady and then no one. Why can't we read something simple like Mr. Nice?,Living Room

7,3,Jeremy,Mark,Are we doing a deal? A grubby deal like oil men or corrupt councillors?,Mark's Room

7,5,Mark,Dobby,"God yeah, the year Dad's British Aerospace shares went kaput, he said we couldn't afford an M&S Christmas pudding, but Mum bought a secret one and steamed it in the garage.

7,5,Dobby,Mark,"It's meant to be amazing, should we, do it this week?",Living Room
7,5,Mark,Dobby,"Uh, sure, it's just... we watched all the Losts and they were somewhat OK, and Heroes had some interesting themes, but also quite a lot of not-so-interesting themes, and Prison Break, by the end, I very much felt that I wanted to break out of the prison that Prison Break had become for us. It's just, don't you think maybe we should go out?",Living Room

7,5,Mark,Dobby,"Dobby, where do you see yourself in five years? I mean, for example, would you want to learn sailing at all, or golf?",Living Room
7,5,Dobby,Mark,I wouldn't mind getting a strap-on and you and me spit-roasting Cameron from the Boden catalogue. Is that the sort of thing you have in mind?,Living Room

7,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly, ""the more the merrier"", as they said as another poor soul was crammed into the black hole of Calcutta. Jeremy, where are the potatoes?",Kitchen

7,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Are you sure potatoes aren't veg? Aren't they... not earth but like, salt. I mean, tomatoes are fruit, and potatoes are... bread? No, I mean they're wheat-y, they don't go in the drawer in the fridge, so... yeah?",Kitchen
7,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, obviously potatoes are vegetables.",Kitchen

7,5,Sarah,Jeremy,"So, what? Are you religious now or something? Do you believe in Jesus?",Hall
7,5,Jeremy,Sarah,"Of course I don't believe in Jesus, but I do believe in Christmas, I'm a Christmas-ist.",Hall
7,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, I did it, I resisted something for something else. That was... something.",Hall
7,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey Mark, guess what, I was just offered sex and I turned it down.",Hall
7,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, well congratulations.",Hall
7,5,Jeremy,Mark,I did it for Father Christmas.,Hall
7,5,Mark,Mark,"God, look at him. He probably thinks Father Christmas died for our sins.",Living Room
7,5,Pam,Mark,"We heard the door, what happened?",Living Room
7,5,Mark,Pam,Dobby's gone.,Living Room
7,5,Dan,Mark,"Good riddance to bad rubbish. You can do a lot better than that, Marco.",Living Room
7,5,Mark,Dan,"Well, no actually, because she's great and thanks to you, I'm a dick. So I was punching well above my weight.",Living Room
7,5,Dan,Mark,"Pass me some of that ham, will you? I think it's the only meat on the table unlikely to kill me.",Living Room
7,5,Mark,Dan,Allow me.,Living Room
7,5,Mark,Mark,"You want ham, well you're gonna get ham. See how you like this ham!",Living Room

7,5,Mark,Sarah,"Sarah, crack open the Pictionary. Merry Christ-Mark everyone!",Living Room
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Nothing from Dobby since Christmas. I want to call again, but when I leave long messages, I have this nagging sense that I'll end up hearing them played back to me in a court of law.",Living Room
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Ah, don't stress it man. We're gonna have new years dude, Darty style. Remember that time we were coming back from Cinderella's and Pej put his pants on the taxi driver's head and he couldn't see a thing?",Living Room
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah that would have been more hilarious had I not been literally weeping with fear.,Living Room
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, come on man. Shake your booty. Tonight, even Paxman's out, hoovering up lines of crank off Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Tonight's the big one!",Living Room
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, all rational people agree it's a truth self-evident that it's impossible to have a good time on New Year's Eve. The pressure's too immense. All I want is to go to Johnson's, find Dobby, and sort everything out.",Living Room
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, we'll go to Johnson's as a stomach liner, a seat warmer. But then I'm taking you on a punani hunt!",Living Room

7,6,Zahra,Jeremy,I was in the area. Thought I might pop by.,Hall
7,6,Jeremy,Zahra,Yeah?,Hall

7,6,Zahra,Jeremy,Jez!,Hall
7,6,Jeremy,Zahra,"Sorry, that was probably totally inappropriate. It's just, you know, sometimes ""the scent of a woman"".",Hall
7,6,Zahra,Jeremy,"OK, the truth is I came here to tell you that Ben and me. We're finished. I found out he slept with someone else.",Hall
7,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,God.,Hall
7,6,Jeremy,Zahra,"Who would have sex with Ben?! Apart from you, obviously.",Hall

7,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,Don't say yes too quick. Don't say yes too quick.,Hall
7,6,Jeremy,Zahra,Yes!,Hall
7,6,Zahra,Jeremy,"Cause I really, really like you, Jez. And Ben's going to stop paying my rent. And I think we just click. And we can do a direct debit, or whatever!",Hall
7,6,Jeremy,Zahra,"Sure. I mean, Ben will definitely fire me, but I'll just get another job. I could easily start my own music merchandise website. I mean, I'm gonna get a laptop, so, er, yeah, sorted.",Hall
7,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,I'm moving in! I'm going to be the boyfriend who pays rent! I'm her rent boy but not sucking cock in a phone box. Eating pussy on a tumble dryer!,Hall

7,6,Zahra,Ben,"Hello? Oh. Hi, Ben.",Johnson's Place
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So, er, listen, dude, listen. You know how women, when they live together, their periodicals start arriving at the same time, and how dogs come to look like their owners? Well, I really wouldn't want that to happen to us, so it actually... it actually looks like I'm going to be moving out.",Johnson's Place
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Are you- Has Super Hans been talking about his kibbutz idea again? Cause I can assure you, the State of Israel will not allow a ""kibbutz for hotties"".",Johnson's Place
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,No. Zahra's split up with Ben and she's asked me to move in with her.,Johnson's Place

7,6,Johnson,Jeremy,"Yes, I knew that, so the joke's on you.",Johnson's Place
7,6,Jeremy,Johnson,"Well, I didn't realise you knew that, so it can't have been a very good joke. Happy New Year.",Johnson's Place

7,6,Zahra,Jeremy,He thinks they're seminal.,Johnson's Place

7,6,Mark,Johnson,I don't know.,Johnson's Place

7,6,Mark,Johnson,"Alan, are you still...?",Johnson's Place
7,6,Johnson,Mark,"Oh, yeah. Appletise. Five years, clean and serene. Hey, just 'cause you're looking at some titties, doesn't mean you have to suck on the nip-nips, right?",Johnson's Place
7,6,Mark,Johnson,"Thanks, Alan. I'll get stuck into that later.",Johnson's Place
7,6,Johnson,Mark,"Oh, come on, Mark! A Beck's, a simple Beck's. Up on the South Downs, a haversack full of Beck's? That's the dream, ain't it?",Johnson's Place

7,6,Johnson,Mark,"I don't know, Mark. We've been over this. She might pop in. Mmm, cold white wine. Ain't that fine?",Johnson's Place
7,6,Mark,Mark,"Hmm. He's conned me to his party. 'Cause it's hard to take a legal position on ""might pop in"". Anyone might pop in. Jeffrey Archer, Hugo Chavez, Skinner and Baddiel.",Johnson's Place
7,6,Jeff,Mark,"Aye-aye, Captain Birdseye! So what have you caught then? Some mackerel? Sexual herpes from bumming a tramp?",Johnson's Place
7,6,Mark,Mark,Your insults are absorbed by the theoretical levity of the costume.,Johnson's Place

7,6,Mark,Jeff,"You might say that, but I couldn't possibly comment.",Johnson's Place
7,6,Johnson,Mark,"What? Have you, Mark? Had your dick in the Dob?",Johnson's Place
7,6,Mark,Johnson,"OK, yes. Yes, yes, I've had my dick in the Dob.",Johnson's Place

7,6,Jeff,Mark,"She's a freak, isn't she?",Johnson's Place
7,6,Johnson,Mark,"But what kind of freak? Is she a manimal or a bestselling Flanimal, would you say?",Johnson's Place
7,6,Mark,Mark,Does he want an answer?,Johnson's Place
7,6,Mark,Johnson,I guess she's more of a manimal than a Flanimal.,Johnson's Place

7,6,Sophie,Mark,Uh-huh.,Johnson's Place

7,6,Super Hans,Mark,I don't know what to think. I have seen through the eye of the needle. I've seen it. I've finally bloody seen it! I've pulled open the hurt locker and had a big old rummage round.,Super Hans' Party
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,Let's go in.,Super Hans' Party

7,6,Mark,Super Hans,Bloody hell.,Super Hans' Party

7,6,Mark,Mark,Great. Super Hans in the sidecar.,Super Hans' Party
7,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Who's the chick?,Super Hans' Party

7,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Wow. And what does she...?,Super Hans' Party
7,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,I don't know much about her. She don't speak English. We speak the language of love. And a tiny little bit of German.,Super Hans' Party
7,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Right.,Super Hans' Party

7,6,Mark,Super Hans,"Hans, we get the message. There's probably no need to list all the things you'd put up bottom for your girlfriend.",Super Hans' Party
7,6,Mark,Mark,"Can't believe he's actually moving out. I'm going to be an unemployed single mother stuck in the flat, eating Frosties from a salad bowl, until I die from loneliness. And two weeks later they break down the door to find Ian sucking on my cold, dead teats.",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey, Mark. I think Super Hans' girlfriend fancies me.",Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,Why? Because you've got your punani jeans on?,Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"In the fried chicken place, she bit off half a chicken drummer and then gave the rest to me.",Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,Right. So?,Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,The symbolism? The drummer's my dick.,Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, just because, for some reason, you associate a chicken drumstick with your penis, doesn't mean that anyone was flirting with you.",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,She definitely was.,Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"She gave you some food! When you sneak chunks of my Cathedral City cheddar, is that you taking slices off my dick? So, listen. I'm going to ask Dobby to move in with me.",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,I'm sorry?,Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I've been thinking and I need to make the gesture. And you know, maybe this is the kick up the arse we both need. I could turn your room into an office. Finally nail ""Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs"".",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Right. OK, man. Yeah. Good on you. Because, um, yeah I mean obviously, we've always been amazing mates, but, also a bit like lead weights dragging each other down?",Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly. Living together, it's been like eating a vast portion of chips. Very comforting, but also there's this lurking sense you're killing yourself. Right?",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,Too right. We're moving on! Eh! Eh!,Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,Eh. Eh.,Off-Licence

7,6,Super Hans,Mark,Maybe.,Taxi
7,6,Mark,Super Hans,Right? I'm not sure I-,Taxi
7,6,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, I just love smack. Probably not the right man to ask. Anyway, I'm out the game now. When I first set eyes on this one, it was like my first joint, like my first Bowie track, like my first Ruth Rendell. I just knew. We both did, didn't we, sweetheart? Yeah.",Taxi
7,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yep, she fancies me. I knew it.",Taxi

7,6,Mark,Mark,"If we're going to name his cock after a Clint Eastwood film, it's ""The Unforgiven"".",Big Suze's Place
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,I do feel a bit weird about this. Big Suze has invited everyone except us. You know why? It's cause I sent her those... objects.,Big Suze's Place
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"It's fine, Jeremy. Everyone sends an ex the odd... object. It's a natural part of breaking up.",Big Suze's Place
7,6,Big Suze,Mark,Mark? Jeremy? Super Hans? And a woman? You're all here? Gosh. Have you come straight from... the harbour?,Big Suze's Place
7,6,Mark,Big Suze,It's fancy dress.,Big Suze's Place

7,6,Big Suze,Jeremy,"No, no. You must come in for a bit. Oh, and look, you've brought us some... almost champagne. I'll tell you what, I'll put it there, and if, for any reason, we don't get around to drinking it tonight, you can take it back with you! Yes?",Big Suze's Place
7,6,Super Hans,Big Suze,"Right, Suze, I need a smoke-out. Want to watch me roll up a four-skin?",Big Suze's Place

7,6,Mark,Big Suze,"Suze, do you know, is Dobby here?",Big Suze's Place
7,6,Big Suze,Mark,"Hmm, not sure. There are an awful lot of, what I'm sure you won't mind me calling, ""your types"" here! So... But listen, since you've both been so wonderfully clever and made it here without an invitation card or anything, would you mind being total stars and helping out? Is that all right? So that's for you. And yes? Listen, once you've done a couple of rounds, please feel free to sit down and have a very quick drink. OK? Thanks.",Big Suze's Place
7,6,Mark,Mark,"OK, Dobby. I'm going to find you and I'm going to feed you.",Big Suze's Place

8,1,Johnson,Others,"Hi guys. My first memory of this great little guy in the big old box here, was when Gerrard's cheeky little face poked round my door at JLB. He was sniffing around for a raise that, given what I don't think anyone will mind me saying, were his very limited attributes was bloody outrageous! Look, nothing can make today all right. But maybe we can take some comfort from the brutal reality that the weak must make way for the strong. Evolution marches on, the scythe is remorseless.

8,1,Jeremy,Others,"So what do you want me to do? Pull down my pants and fertilise the plants? Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you? Yeah, then you'd have a real patient on your hands. More mental millions for your high interest account, or ISA, or share portfolio, or to spend on your wife, or your boyfriend, chowing down on an Aberdeen Angus steak from your Volkswagen Passat. That's right, kemosabe, I've got your number. Yeah, doesn't feel very nice when the searchlight is turned on the searchlight operator. Hmm, yeah, pal?

8,2,Mark,Greg,Oh. Of course. The Euro. The bloody Euro. Getting it wrong again.,Burger Van
8,2,Greg,Mark,It's hitting everyone. The upshot is we're having to ask all our authors to put in 2K just to cover the extra costs.,Burger Van
8,2,Mark,Greg,Oh... right.,Burger Van

8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Does J.K. Rowling pay to have Harry Potter books published?,Living Room

8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Right. OK.,Living Room

8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm the one who should be doing an intervention. On you! Because, my friend, you are a vanity life coach!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"My course is a proper qualification! It's not a pretend book from a pretend publishers, getting printed on pretend paper!",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, well, even if you complete your ludicrously short course, you're never going to be a life coach. It's just another dream, like being a pop star, or a front bottom inspector!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"That wasn't a career, that was a T-shirt!",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, well, a front bottom inspector is still a more realistic career option for you, than life coach!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"I threw that T-shirt out months ago! You know why? Because it was tasteless. I was embarrassed to wear it in public. That's the Jeremy you're dealing with now, that's how much I've grown as an individual.",Mark's Room

But, tonight, I'm not gonna bury you in it with me. Except with the admittedly generous mounds of peanuts that you'll see I've provided. No, tonight I just want to say that this book is a disaster! It's a travesty! It's proof of a broken promise. But, I want to announce here that I will be aggressively pursuing British London in the small claims court.

8,3,Mark,Dobby,"So, I thought Trish could sit here, Neil can sit here, and Simon (the ex-boyfriend) can sit there.",Living Room
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,"And if anyone tries to move from the seating plan, I'll taser them.",Living Room
8,3,Dobby,Mark,"Mark, I think you need to take a chill pill from your frankly inadequate supply.",Living Room
8,3,Mark,Dobby,"Sorry, yes, I guess I am a bit nervous 'cause this is the first time we've hosted a social evening together in our soon-to-be joint home.",Living Room
8,3,Dobby,Mark,"Don't sweat it, dude. Oh, by the way, Simon's invited me to come away for the weekend for his thirtieth.",Living Room
8,3,Mark,Mark,Sex with the ex.,Living Room
8,3,Mark,Dobby,Yeah? You and him?,Living Room
8,3,Dobby,Mark,And the whole website gang.,Living Room
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, thank God.",Living Room
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I've got a website opportunity, actually. Super Hans has sorted us out a website, and get this, it's empty.",Living Room
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,Right.,Living Room
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, he's wangled us a website for us to do shit on. Business, creative, whatever. Totally blank. Big opportunity. You in?",Living Room
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, Jez, I guess that would be an exciting opportunity if it was the last website ever.",Living Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"I mean to say, you know, cut him some slack. He was in the Beatles...",Living Room
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Finally, the use of Jeremy and Hans becomes clear. They're my normality cloaks, allowing me to slip into human society and wreak my evil doings/make friends and relax.",Living Room
8,3,Simon,Mark,"Nice place, Mark. So many biscuits. Is this a normal night for you?",Living Room
8,3,Mark,Simon,"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Me... and my guys, and our cannabis. No thanks, I'm full.",Living Room

8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"I'm thinking of joining a gym, get back on a positive track.",Living Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"I've always suspected that getting on a positive track is a good idea. But now I'm a professional life coach, I can confirm, you know, medically, that it is a good idea. You know, if you ever want to speak to anyone, I am a fully qualified life coach.",Living Room
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Yes, and I printed his qualification, as a treat.",Living Room
8,3,Super Hans,Simon,"There's a quarter there. If you weigh it, it will appear to come in light 'cause it's helium weed.",Living Room
8,3,Simon,Super Hans,"Tell you what Hans, Jez, you should come to my thirtieth.",Living Room
8,3,Simon,Mark,"And you, Mark. Paintball till we drop and then smoke till we pop.",Living Room

8,3,Jeremy,Simon,Cool.,Living Room
8,3,Mark,Simon,Great.,Living Room
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, paintballing weekend. It's so obvious he fancies Dobby. He's just using it as cover. But he won't be expecting how incredibly taciturn and deflating I can be in social situations. The fun stops here, my friend.",Living Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"Yeah, I mean, I really just want a... honest broker, someone to chat through some shit with.",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Is it OK, the bed? Is it a bit like, at any moment, I might jump on him and hump him better? I could hump him. I wonder if I'll hump many clients.",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"I've always really wanted to do footie coaching. And I've got the first FA badge, but it's hard.",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"OK. So, what seems to be stopping you?",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"Well, I've got my job.",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"Well, quit your job.",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,You think so?,Jez's Room

8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Case closed, next.",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"I mean, it's hard to find paid coaching work. And um, Alice, my wife, she wonders if it's not a bit late to get into all this?",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,OK.,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Might have a poke about a bit.,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,How are things in the relationship?,Jez's Room

8,3,Jeremy,Neil,Tell me about the sexual side of the relationship.,Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"Well, to be honest, it's... it's not good.",Jez's Room

8,3,Jeremy,Neil,Go on.,Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"Well, look, I mean, I guess I can say, I like to be... dominated in the bedroom.",Jez's Room

8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"There's no judgment here, Neil.",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,I've also experimented with same-sex experiences.,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Ooh, tell me more.",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"So, in the relationship, do you think you're getting really fulfilled?",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,Alice has this... medical condition which makes-,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,We don't need to go into that. That's not part of it.,Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"Right, what is part of it?",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"I'll tell you what's part of it. Now, tell me more about these gay feelings. They sound interesting, I mean, important.",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"I supposed, I mean, I was hoping to talk about the footie coaching?",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"I mean, everything's connected. Um, a relationship, it, er- well, a relationship, it has some-",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,where am I going here?,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,A relationship is a lot like a real ship. It needs to be moving forward. It needs to be properly maintained.,Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,Yes. Yeah. I get that.,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,He gets that? I'm a life coach!,Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,"I mean, the truth is, I have had thoughts about leaving Alice.",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"If you sometimes want to do something, you should do it.",Jez's Room
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,Yes?,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,Yes. What you sometimes think you should do is what you should do. That's at the very core of the Usbourne philosophy.,Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Kiss my cheeks, Dr. Freud. I'm on fire.",Jez's Room
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,That's not my fault. I was definitely on fire.,Cottage
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,"So, Neil broke up with Alice. She's in tears in Crofton Park, apparently.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,Because you told him to leave her.,Cottage
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,It was his idea. I just encouraged him to believe in himself.,Cottage
8,3,Simon,Super Hans,"You've got nothing, no weed at all?",Cottage
8,3,Super Hans,Simon,I'm not Muffin the fucking drugs mule mate.,Cottage
8,3,Simon,Super Hans,Why do you think I invited you?,Cottage

8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, shit.",Cottage
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,Can we grab five? 'Cause my head's in fucking pieces.,Cottage
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,You want to book in a session next week?,Cottage
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,I'm really starting to regret leaving Alice.,Cottage
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,Uh-huh.,Cottage
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,I really think it was a terrible idea.,Cottage
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"Sorry, dude, but you're kind of harshing my mellow.",Cottage
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,She says she won't have me back.,Cottage
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"Yeah, I feel for you, but I'm off the clock.",Cottage
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,What should I do?,Cottage
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"Park it, Neil. Save it till... I don't know, Wednesday?",Cottage
8,3,Simon,Others,"OK, OK, everyone, hat game. Hat's full of band names.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Mark,Paintballing and the hat game? Terrific.,Cottage
8,3,Simon,Others,"So, teams are Jeremy and Super Hans, Mark and Neil, me and Mrs. Dob Dobalina. Sorry, hun.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Obviously, and no doubt, the prize/forfeit for the losing/winning team is languorous copulation.",Cottage
8,3,Trish,Others,"OK, time starts now.",Cottage
8,3,Dobby,Simon,"OK, you properly love them and fair dos.",Cottage
8,3,Simon,Dobby,Elbow.,Cottage
8,3,Dobby,Simon,Correct.,Cottage

8,3,Trish,Mark,"OK, Mark, Neil, you are up.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Mark,"And so the descent into hell begins. Just hope they're all Snow Patrol. If it's not Snow Patrol or the Beatles, I am so fucked.",Cottage

8,3,Mark,Neil,Madonna.,Cottage
8,3,Neil,Mark,"Group. Five-piece, I think.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Neil,"OK, so, not the Beatles, 'cause famously, they were a four-piece. Bit of trivia. Susan Doyle, Boyle.",Cottage
8,3,Neil,Mark,What?,Cottage
8,3,Mark,Neil,"Sorry, my mind's just drowning in bands, all the bands.",Cottage

8,3,Mark,Simon,"I don't know, OK? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, so fuck off.",Cottage
8,3,Trish,Mark,Time's up.,Cottage
8,3,Neil,Mark,Hot Chip.,Cottage
8,3,Mark,Neil,"Ah, yeah, OK. I thought it might be Hot Chips.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Round one to you, Simon. Next time we do a quiz, it'll be on Napoleon, and while you might scrape through a few Waterloo questions, when I pin you down on the emperor's domestic reforms, I will fuck you very hard in the mouth.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,"When I woke up, Dobby was already having a coffee and a joint with Simon.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,They found some dope?,Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Jeremy,"My dope. I drove to Brighton at seven thirty to buy some. Half an ounce of hash for a blim of approval. God, I hate myself.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Super Hans,"You shouldn't hate yourself, man.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Stop life coaching him, Jeremy.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,I'm not.,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,"Hey, guys.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"At last, military strategy. You're on my turf, music geeks.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"All right, Neil?",Paintballing
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,No. I've left thirty-six messages for Alice.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"Great. Well, that's clearly all part of your particular process, so well done. That's all normal and good.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Possibly.,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,We sorted out the teams. You're reds.,Paintballing
8,3,Trish,Mark,It's ten minutes to scatter. Then let the death hunt commence.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Trish,Death hunt?,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Mmm, the death hunt. That sounds relaxing and fun.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Mark,"Sorry, Mark, I'm yellow. Look out for the grenades.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Dobby,Grenades? Can we have some grenades?,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,This is private stash.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Simon,We want one of those. I'm happy to pay.,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,Pay? Who you gonna pay?,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Simon,"I don't know, the... men.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,"There aren't any men here, dude. It's just us.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,No men? Not even a man?,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,We're going off-road.,Paintballing
8,3,Trish,Mark,There's no rules. Just take out every member of the opposite team to win.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"By that, she means me.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,Death hunt!,Paintballing
8,3,Others,Mark,Death hunt!,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Dobby,"Dobs, this isn't fair. Look at us.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Others,"Yellow team, move out.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,Holding hands? That's not military. I'm pretty sure Rommel never held hands.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Why does there have to be a death hunt, Mark? Why does war even exist? Why can't we all just have a game of footie like how England beat Germany for the first world war?",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know how to answer that, Jeremy.",Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,Hmm.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Ah, this is a paintballing nightmare. Must escape, must not die. Enjoy the relaxing game. Keep girlfriend from ex sex.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Others,"We're coming to paint you, shitheads!",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Ah, yes, a ditch. I should burrow further and further into the earth like the worm that I am.",Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Mark, it's me.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Hans?,Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,I think I've just spotted some kind of bunker.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Brilliant.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Wonder if Simon found a bunker. I wonder if he's in there with Dobby. Oh, God.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Probably. War makes people horny. Yalta. Yalta was hardcore. Stalin and Roosevelt sandwich. Churchill sat on the side, wanking. Yeah?",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,Can we hide with you?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,We're not hiding. We're in a holding pattern.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Hmm, the lifeboat is getting overcrowded.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Mark,Hi.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Deena,Hi.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Yes, it's more the merrier in the lifeboat. You can't have too many people in a lifeboat. That's what they never, ever, ever fucking say.",Bunker
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Is this allowed? Just run away from the war?,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,The action of the sane man through the ages.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,They were forming a kill squad 'cause of Alice. Kill squad. That's not a nice squad.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Don't sweat it. Alice is a doom-monger. Long term, Neil's gonna be very happy he chucked her.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"That was my hunch, 'cause, you know, well, I'm bound by strict confidentiality, but I think it's OK to tell you because you know him a bit. Neil likes to get handcuffed and then pulled off with gloves on.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Does he?,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Yeah. This is all confidential, and I wouldn't be telling you unless it was interesting. That would be unprofessional, but she wouldn't wear the gloves even at Christmas.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Bloody hell.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Can you keep a secret?,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,I don't know.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,He sucked a guy off at college and thinks he might want to do it again.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Wow, OK. What about the football coaching thing?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Yeah.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,What was the football coaching thing? There was something about his job. He really liked his job or something.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"I really think I've said enough, to be honest.",Paintballing
8,3,Others,Jeremy,"Hey, gaylord, you gonna bum the lesbo?",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Others,What's that?,Paintballing
8,3,Others,Dobby,Lesbo.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Others,"Yeah? Eat this, motherfucker.",Paintballing
8,3,Others,Dobby,Fuck's sake.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Others,"And if I was gay, why would I want to bum her? That doesn't even make sense. Taste my logic gun, bitch man.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"God, this is so frightening and boring, just like a real war. Cowering in a foxhole for months. I could've got this sensation of anxiety and fear at home by drinking three cafetieres of coffee and then lying under my bed and calling my dad after ten PM.",Bunker
8,3,Trish,Simon,They went this way. Scour the area.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Charlie,"Guys, look, they're onto you. There are too many of us here.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Deena,"All right, what about this? Matches. Two longies, two shorties. Pick.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Super Hans,OK.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Deena,"Short, you're going, sorry.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Super Hans,Shit.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,Mate. Long. Mark.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, one short, one long.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Short, congratulations.",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,But-,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,"Yeah, first short goes, first long goes, and the last one is long, so I'm good. Bad luck, guys.",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,Is that right?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,"Yeah, yeah, of course it's right-",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"innit, Mark?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Mm, a bit horrible, but-",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Charlie,"That's right, sorry.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,"Hey, we don't make the rules.",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,"Well, you did make the rules.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Charlie,I think that you might be OK.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,You won't be OK.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Deena,Yeah?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Deena,"Listen up, Hall and Oates, you're going for a little walk, and you may be some time.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Fuck, it worked. Maybe I should use the matches to get Jeremy to move out. Long, he leaves, short, he leaves.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Trish,"Ow, fuck.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Jesus, they're painting those poor bastards like the Forth Bridge.",Bunker
8,3,Trish,Simon,"All right, bunker cleared. Moving on.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Thank God.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, they're lucky they didn't get hit by the snitch.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,The snitch?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Golden snitch. Apparently, the yellows like to mix it up a bit, chuck a ball bearing in the paintball pot to make things interesting.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,A ball bearing? But that would- that'd kill you!,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"No, no. I mean, it would go in you.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,It'd go in you?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, it'd go in you a bit, wouldn't it? From one of those guns. A fucking ball bearing?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Oh, God.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Splat an eyeball, take out your windpipe. Take a nut off like that. You'll be all right, unless you get hit in a sensitive area.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"But I'm covered in sensitive areas. I can't see a single part of me that I would nominate to be smashed with a high-velocity ball bearing. Hans, I'm really sorry, but I think I need to do a poo.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"You're not pooing in the bunker, Mark.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,You had a wee.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, a little bit of wee compared to a great big poo? You're not pooing in this bunker. If you poo in the bunker, I will shoot you.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Could keep it in. But then, what if I get into a combat situation and my valves go floppy?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Oh, for God's sake.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"The charge of the shit brigade. Uh, force ten poo from Navarone. I thought humanity had evolved beyond this. This is a really fun weekend. Could it be any worse? Maybe. If Dobby and Simon came round the corner humping and then shot me with my pants down. Started this war as Napoleon, but I'm reduced to wiping my bum with his biography. Although I am able to pick a section I've already read. Plus, it's not like Napoleon is wiping his bum with pages of my biography, so I am, to an extent, maybe, winning.",Bunker
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Simon. Wants to know if I'll join him in his bunker for a party.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Yeah, Hitler put the bad vibe on the bunker party, like he did with so much else.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"I really shouldn't be talking to you about this, should I?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"It's cool. I am a professional life coach, remember. Everything you say will be strictly confidential.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"What's Mark like, to live with?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Well, I hate living with him, but I never want it to end. Why is that? Is it like the Stockholm syndrome where you want to go and live in Stockholm with a dick or something?",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,That is quite a long wait. Is he a secret paedo or something?,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"No, obviously, no.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,She's asking for it. She's begging for... a life coaching.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,How are you feeling about moving in with him?,Paintballing

8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Oh my God, I was just chatting to Trish, big news.",Bar
8,6,Mark,Dobby,What?,Bar
8,6,Dobby,Mark,She's a transsexual. She's started hormone therapy and in January she's having the op.,Bar
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Oh my God, really?",Bar
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"No, of course not, dickhead! The company's got a six-month project in New York and Trish asked how I'd feel about being part of it.",Bar
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, OK. Wow.",Bar
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"It's between me and Claire with the hair. So don't mention it to anyone. God, I've been looking forward to moving in with you for months but-",Bar
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh, the but.",Bar
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Oh it's difficult.,Bar
8,6,Mark,Dobby,Yeah. God. Yeah.,Bar

8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"You can come round any time you like, old friend.",Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,That's nice. He's so nice. He might even let me steal his girlfriend.,Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, loose keys. Never owned a keyring, waste of money.",Hall
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah?,Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Your Holsten Pils keyring? The guys over at Holsten are laughing their arses off at you, advertising their beer to yourself every time you come home.",Hall

8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Hi, Dobs. Yeah, great.",Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wet from the shower, warm from the oven.",Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,Great to get finally bagged up. It's like a chrysalis. I'm going to emerge like some kind of mad butterfly. Just came back to give Mark my keys.,Hall
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Stay for a cup of tea, at least.",Hall
8,6,Dobby,Jeremy,"Yeah, tea, or Um Bongo? The delicious tropical juice drink with overtones of colonial racism.",Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, I love you. It's all good. Except it's all so very bad. Oh, my room. It's like looking at my own grave, except I'm so dead there's not even a body in it.",Hall
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"It's going to be my home office. Funny, eh?",Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,What happened to the bed and the desk?,Hall
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Dobby and me drove them to the dump. There's a great little area to leave stuff someone else might want.,Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Did you see anyone take them?,Hall
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Actually, someone did take the bed, a woman.",Hall
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, that's nice to know. Gone to a good home, old beddy.",Hall
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah.,Hall
8,6,Mark,Mark,"She was very much the on-methadone, living-in-a-halfway-house type, but probably best not to mention that.",Hall

8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, great.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, good. I was worried it wouldn't be nice.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, no, it's nice. I mean, little bump, cos my room is a bit... full of snakes.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Snakes?,Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, it's a bit of a snake pit. But we're going to bag them up once we get some coke and get on a bagging vibe. Until then, I'm sleeping on the sofa, which is great. Except Hans is... something of a night owl.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh. But aside from the snakes and the no sleep, good?",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, really good. I mean, we are taking quite a lot of drugs. I did wonder, before, you know? Will it be too much drugs at Hans'? I mean, he talks a lot about them but he probably doesn't take that many. But it turns out, he does do a hell of a lot.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Right.,Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah. We had a system but it kind of broke down.,Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Surprise, surprise.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,That's probably a bit of a hazard with drug-taking.,Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You need to be really careful with the ratios. We just got the ratios a bit off. So, I do think I am addicted to drugs now.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, you've always been addicted to drugs, Jeremy.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm not a drug addict. Not until very, very recently.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,You smoke marijuana every day and always have.,Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"That's not being a drug addict, Mark, you moron. That's just having a little number to take the edge off. So, um, Dobby's finally moved in. Congratulations.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"You lucky, lucky bastard.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Actually, she's not moving in till next week, when Jason's van's all fixed up.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, right.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"""Jason's van""? That sounds like the kind of bullshit I come up with.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I was worried she was delaying on purpose, having cold feet.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yes! God, I'm such a bad friend.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,And now she's had this job offer in New York that I'm not supposed to talk about. Do you think she could have made that up to avoid moving in?,Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Duh, obviously.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I wouldn't worry, mate.",Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, I've booked a romantic weekend away for us.",Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,Shit.,Kitchen
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Great.,Kitchen
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm gonna nail down this New York lie. Get her away, confront her and watch her squirm.",Kitchen

8,6,Simon,Mark,"So what are you? Defence, attack, goalie?",5-a-side
8,6,Mark,Simon,"Bit of this, bit- bit of that. D'you see the game the other night?",5-a-side
8,6,Simon,Mark,Which game?,5-a-side
8,6,Mark,Simon,"The- the big fixture. Oh, you missed a great one. It was a really great game.",5-a-side

8,6,Mark,Simon,"So, I hear something big might be happening for you guys on the other side of the pond?",5-a-side
8,6,Simon,Mark,"Make sure you stay in some space, yeah, Mark?",5-a-side
8,6,Mark,Simon,"Yeah, dude, don't worry. I've got this whole wing side on lockdown. New York-based project, yeah?",5-a-side
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Hmm, suspiciously quiet. Maybe Dobby is playing me for a trout. There is no New York deal!",5-a-side
8,6,Simon,Mark,Take him out. Take him out!,5-a-side
8,6,Mark,Simon,"What? What? That was too hard! Someone's going to get hurt if you kick it that hard! I mean, that was just too hard, correct?",5-a-side
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Need to admit I love Dobby. Who to tell first? Her, more exciting. Him, more noble. Or together? More Jeremy Kyle, with a small chance he might cave my head in with his 2003 Personal Finance Award.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,You've got some paint on the light switch.,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, well, that's gonna happen, unless I take forever.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Is this white? Is this actual white?,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"It's apple white, it's cheaper.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, I don't want slightly green white. Oh, Jez, this isn't what I wanted at all!",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, come on, Mark. You knew when you hired me it wasn't gonna be a professional job.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Hey, Dobs.",Jez's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Why the fuck have you been spying on me?,Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,I'm sorry?,Jez's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Did you try and squeeze information out of Simon about the New York job while pretending to play football?,Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"I wasn't pretending. I just happened to be passing and felt like a kick-around and, in the lulls, tried to strike up friendly banter.",Jez's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,You happened to be passing a sports centre in Hackney on the way from your flat in Croydon to your corner shop in Croydon?,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Ooh, poor old Mark. The old stepping-on-the-rake trick. All I have to do is paint and wait. Wait and paint.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"I suppose, I didn't believe you liked me enough to move in with me.",Mark's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Don't be a fucking dickhead.,Mark's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"I guess it's things like calling me a ""fucking dickhead"" so much.",Mark's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Dickhead is a term of endearment, knobhead. Of course the job is real.",Mark's Room
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh, fuck.",Mark's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,And now they've offered me the job. They've chosen me over Claire.,Mark's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Well, congratulations.",Mark's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Yeah. Claire's never gonna get on until she rethinks the hair. So, I don't know what to do.",Mark's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Well, if- if you don't mind me making a suggestion - why don't you stay and move in with me?",Mark's Room
8,6,Dobby,Mark,But this is a big opportunity. New York. It's massive.,Mark's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Sure, the Massive Apple. But at the same time, I've just had the home office painted. I'll be moving my desk in there. You can have this whole bit.",Mark's Room
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Mmm, is she going to buy this? Might have to sex up the bit.",Mark's Room
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"It ain't Greenwich Village, but it's yours.",Mark's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I actually did quite a good job, though I say it myself.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I'm sorry I doubted you.,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,No problemo. I'd have doubted me too if- hang on. Have you cleaned the paint off that light switch?,Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jez, why would I-?",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, you bloody did! This is loads better than when I left it.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm sorry, I just wanted it to be nice, and obviously you're not competent.",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, God, look. All the charm's gone. All my little touches. It's like you've put a fluorescent safety jacket on the Mona Lisa.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, Dobby's thinking about taking the job in New York.",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, no.",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, God.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,But I've got a plan. I'm gonna push things up a gear. I'm going to ask Dobby to marry me.,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,Fuck!,Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I just think now's the time for a big statement. Show her how I really feel. I'm going to pop the question in the Quantocks on the weekend. Dobby's driving. She's stopping off to see Gerrard's sister and her depressing laundry outlet in Reading.,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"The Quantocks? Where you accidentally proposed to Sophie? Is that where you have to ask women to marry you, by law?",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, do you think it's a good plan? Show her how I feel?",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, honestly...",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,This is the moment. Got to tell him the truth. Tell him I love Dobby. Grasp the nettle and get stung to fuck and face the firing squad and get shot to bloody pieces.,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, good plan.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Thanks, Jez. Good to talk it through with a mate. Ah!",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Ah!,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Didn't grasp the nettle, obviously. Who would grasp a fucking nettle?",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"It's very good of you to help me, Jez, but it's not the 1830s. I, I think I'll survive the terrifying train experience.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Got to tell him I love Dobby. That's the honourable way. Tell him, then tell Dobby. Dobby will say she needs to think about it. but I'll be able to tell she really does love me, probably. And we buy Mark a cake and all have a right old laugh?",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, well, er, thanks. See you Monday.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Hope everything goes well.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Thanks, mate.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,Got to say it. Got to say something.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"The train's gonna leave, Jeremy.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. So, apologies, but I think you should know I'm in love with Dobby.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm sorry, what the fucking hell are you talking about?",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I thought it was only fair for you to know. Goodbye. Sorry, can I just get past?",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Before my best friend kills me with a tuna baguette. Oh, my fucking God, this train is running on time. This is unprecedented. Oh, no. Oh, fuck! Oh, back to the scene of the crime to face the music and dance, like some mad musical murderer. How the hell am I gonna play this? Just going to totally fucking ignore it. It never happened.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So, I'm back. Oh, look, an interview with the new USA national football coach, J√ºrgen Klinsmann.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What in the name of holy fuck is going on?,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, I'm really, really sorry but Dobby... I mean, she's just so lovely.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I know she's lovely. That, sadly, appears to be one thing that we agree on.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I feel terrible. I do. I've been carrying around this weight for months.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, you thought it was about time to drop it on my head?",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You don't understand, Mark. I'm in love with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. The love tap is gushing.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, turn it off.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I can't. I've tried.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, try harder. Put some fucking elbow grease into it.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"How am I supposed to do that when there's no such thing as elbow grease? Look, Mark, I knew how much this would hurt you, how angry you'd be. That's why I planned to tell you and then get off the train right afterwards.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,How incredibly noble.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"God, this is so stressful. I feel terrible.",Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Others,"Tickets, please.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I don't suppose you'd lend me some money for a drink? Bit of lager?,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I am the very last person on this train who would lend you money, Jeremy. Currently, the very thing that would solve all my problems is you dying of thirst.",Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Jeremy,"Tickets, please.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,"Yeah, I wasn't meant to be here. I was just helping him with his luggage.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Not by request.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,And then the doors closed. I- I've come on the train by mistake.,Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Jeremy,"Standard single, that's, er, £34.60.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, would you mind?",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, I would mind.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, for God's sake, it's thirty quid, I'll pay you back.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,"Look, I'm sorry about this, but this is really between you two rather than me. I mean, we're friends, we live together.",Train
8,6,Mark,Ticket Inspector,"No, we don't.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,We're on a weird one. He's got the money. Ask him why he won't pay.,Train
8,6,Mark,Ticket Inspector,The situation is perfectly simple. There's a passenger without a ticket who refuses to pay for one. You should remove him from the train.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,She can't throw me off a moving train in the middle of nowhere! What if I walk on the tracks? I might die.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Here's a tip, Jeremy. Don't walk on the tracks.",Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Jeremy,I'm going to have to ask you to leave the train at the next station.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,"Great with me, that's where we're going.",Train
8,6,Mark,Ticket Inspector,That's your punishment of last recourse? Free travel?,Train
8,6,Mark,Mark,Probably off to get him a complimentary fare-dodger's colouring book.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I can't believe you're actually thinking of coming.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I need to tell Dobby. I told you, like an honourable man.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,An honourable man would have become a monk or chopped his nuts off or gone to Morocco and become a paedo or a charity worker.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"That's as may be, but by my own code of ethics...",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Incredibly shitty ethics.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"...I think I've done the right thing. So, now, I'm going to come with you and tell Dobby how I feel. I mean, you've got to admit, me and Dobby are a better fit than you. We click.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I haven't heard any clicking.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, the clicking is continuous! That's why you haven't noticed it. Click, click, click, click, click, click.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, me and Dobby make a great team. Opposites attract.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, they don't. Not really. That's just something that scientists and people in horrible relationships say. I mean, be honest, the things you always moan about Dobby. I mean, you know, the DJ bars, the dope smoking, the poorly arranged finances. Don't they remind you of someone?",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I told you all those quibbles in a different era. You can't use them against me now in this kangaroo court of love.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Me and Dobby don't quibble.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Because you never spend any time together!,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, I'm really, really serious, Mark. I can't see a way out of this. I think maybe... like... like one of us should kill ourselves.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"The life coach speaks! Maybe the reason you think you're in love with Dobby is that she's the woman you've been spending most time with recently. If you'd spent the same amount of time with, I don't know, her, then you might fall in love with her instead.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Do you think I'm some kind of sex duckling who'll follow anyone around who's got breasts and a vagina?,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,No.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I love Dobby, Mark! And I know it's true love because I'm prepared to sacrifice my closest friendship for it. I'm gonna tell her.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I think we need a cooling-off period. Just go back to London, find out what Nancy's up to, watch some pornos, have a couple of gay flings and then, at the end of two weeks, if you still feel the same, then maybe you can say something.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"By which time, you've got her all married like a trussed-up hog.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"If you agree to hold off, then I could perhaps promise not to ask Dobby to marry me for a couple of weeks.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,OK. Deal?,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Deal.,Train
8,6,Mark,Mark,Two weeks to find the nicest ring for under two hundred pounds.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, mate. Next one to London's at 12:14. See you later.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. Actually, thinking about it, I don't know if I am gonna go back. Hi.",Train Station
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What the fuck? That was the agreement.,Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I know. I've just got this quite strong feeling you're gonna break the agreement and propose.,Train Station
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I just said I wouldn't.,Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, I know. The thing is, I don't trust you.",Train Station
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What if I say you can't?,Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"If you say that, I might be forced to say something too.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Hey, Dobs.",Train Station
8,6,Dobby,Jeremy,"Hey, Jez.",Train Station
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Er, yeah, I just thought it might be nice if Jeremy joined us for the weekend. Hope you don't mind.",Train Station
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Oh, no, that's totally fine.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Don't mind me. I'll just be hanging out, staying close to my buddy here.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Cause we look after each other. You watch my back, I watch yours. Isn't that right, dude?",Train Station
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"What's going on, Mark?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"I'm really sorry, but I had to bring him. It turns out there's something I need to tell you about Jeremy. I should have told you a long time ago but there's a reason why he's such a dickhead.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Yeah?,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"It's ironic with the life coaching, but it turns out he's a drug addict.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I won't be long! I'll be very quick!,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Right, OK.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Also, he can't get an erection unless he thinks about something... disgusting. I don't want to say what. Plus, he thinks he might be gay. He's eighty percent certain.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Eighty, nice. No need to overdo it.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"So he's dealing with that, which I think is great, and I'm being very supportive over.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"I always thought he might be a bit gay, but more like thirty percent, if I'm honest.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"He's incredibly unstable. So, it was either bring him along or risk getting home to find him, you know. Yeah.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Right, it's just... our special weekend away?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,Change the subject.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"One sugar, Jez?",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, please.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,I gave him one without sugar the other day and he got really angry with himself and smashed up a CD case and tried to eat the pieces.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,He'd better not have bloody said anything or there will be repercussions. Extremely romantic repercussions.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,So did I miss anything?,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Jeremy,I had half a Scotch egg.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,Brilliant.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,"I need a wee too, but I will continue resisting. My bladder is not so easily the master of me, young Jedi.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Pie, Mark?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"No, I'm fine, thanks, Dobs, but I'll cut you a slice.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"He doesn't want any delicious pie? Normally, he loves pie. Suspicious. Very suspicious. He did spend a long time in the kitchen preparing the picnic. Of course! A ring! He's smuggled the bloody engagement ring into the pie!",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Sorry, Dobs, just need to check something.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What the hell are you doing?,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm wise to you, my fine feathered friend.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,He's gone mad. Now to stigmatise the mentally ill.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Apologies. All good. Great picnic, though, Dobs.",Quantocks

It's been a long road and now, as you've found Molly, er, and I don't really want to get into this, but I've started it now, but I'm going to bring it round, so don't worry. People said Molly wasn't right for you. That she was a downer. But you know what? If someone loves someone, he just loves them. And if that person is considered to be a downer, or even a yawn-a-thon, who cares? And even if someone loves another man, or, what's in a name? Or gender? Is it possible to love two people at once? Three? Four is surely the limit. But is it? What is love anyway? Is it, er, an act, or a feeling or, who am I to speak? Who are you to listen? Why is a marriage a marriage? But society says it's wrong for two men to love one another even though now it says it says that now it's OK? Is it OK because society says it's OK? What next? Dogs getting married? Could I marry my own son? No. Possibly not? Correct. Or is it? What I'm trying to say is that people should do whatever they want to do, at a temperature that suits them, within limits.

9,5,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Kid Kave
9,5,Jeremy,Mark,I can't believe it would do that. So sneaky.,Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah. Who could believe a snake would be so duplicitous? They're so famously reliable, snakes.",Kid Kave

9,5,Jeremy,Mark,What are you doing?,Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Jeremy,"It's Ian. I can't find him anywhere. So many bloody kids. I need to somehow get them all cleared out. Maybe shout ""fire"" or I could tell the staff that you were a famous paedo. That would clear the place like Jaws at the beach.",Kid Kave

9,6,Jeremy,Mark,I didn't want you to get fired. I just wanted my extortionate payments written off. You're the one who sold me the ball-crushing loan in the first place. You started it. Hmm? Eh?,Kitchen
9,6,Mark,Mark,He's not luring me back in like that with a lovely savage argument.,Kitchen
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Come on, let's have it out.",Kitchen
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Appealing, but no dice.",Kitchen

9,6,Mark,Mark,April? God love the fax and all the old ways.,Kitchen
9,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"I need a bit of head space. Molly, she's a beast, mate. Marmite in the marge. She's a slob. My peppermint shower gel just laying on its fucking side, oozing. What's that all about? I can't live like that.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,He's never smelt of peppermint.,Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Are you all right?,Hall

9,6,Super Hans,Mark,"Molly's 'Enders, I'm Corrie. Corrie till I die. It's a sign, ain't it? You've got to choose. You can't be City and United, can you?",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Super Hans,"Look, Hans, can you shut up?

9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Why does every solution you come up with involve fucking someone?,Super Hans' Van
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,It's just an idea.,Super Hans' Van
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Do you think they sit around in the cabinet talking about sending Philip Hammond over to fuck Hollande to sort out the Euro?,Super Hans' Van

9,6,April,Mark,It's fine.,Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,"Anyway, what I wanted to say, just before you go, and if you want me to stop, just say, but yeah, I basically think that you're just so funny, and clever, and brilliant, and I really am sorry if that makes things difficult, but I think it's only fair that you should know that I think we'd be great together. I mean, I know I'm not perfect. In fact, I'm not even probably average. I'm a misshapen potato, an oddball.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Feel free to disagree, April.",Coffee Shop

9,6,April,Mark,The truth is I- I do have feelings.,Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,Feelings!,Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,"And it's not all been easy with Angus. Just had a mini-row because he didn't want to spend an extra three hundred pounds on cabin with a porthole. If you're gonna be on a boat for three months, you want a porthole.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,Of course you do. Who wouldn't?,Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Three hundred quid pissed straight out the porthole? Correct call, Angus.",Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,Wow. OK. Wow.,Coffee Shop

9,6,April,Mark,See you. Do what the fuck you want. Goodbye.,Coffee Shop

9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark. How's it going, you lovely rotter?",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Everything's coming up roses. April and I just had an overpriced coffee and did it in the toilets.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Excellent.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"April loves doing it in toilets. In fact, a hundred percent of the times we've done it, we've done it in toilets. I can't wait to do it in the bed.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,It'll be amazing.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"But the big news is that Angus texted to say that he's fucked off to Ibiza, of all places, leaving the coast clear for me to go off with his wife on, the cruise. Me and April, April and me!",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Man, that is so great. I am really happy for you. You deserve that.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I just wanted to say I know things have been a bit difficult between us over the last day or so, what with the punching and the blanking, but you're a good friend, although I still haven't totally forgiven you, mate.",Hall

9,6,Mark,Jeremy,What the fuck have you done?,Hall

9,6,Angus,Mark,"They said they had a sock with a rock in it. They made me drink urine, Mark, human urine.",Jez's Room
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,He greedily gulped from a bedside bottle that happened to be from the golden source.,Hall
9,6,Angus,Mark,"Let me go, Mark. Will you let me go please?",Jez's Room

9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Did you send the texts?,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Yes. I was worried Ibiza was too much. Was it too much?,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"What the fuck have you done, Jeremy?",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,I've done a good one. I've cleared the coast. The coast is clear.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,The coast is not clear. We're all going to prison. You've gone totally loopy. You kidnapped Angus!,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Or, did I invite an unstable oddball for a lift in Hans' van, then back to here for a snifter, then he accidentally got locked in my room for a few hours? It's our word against his.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,This is bad. This is really bad.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,This is brilliant and it totally worked. You're back with April.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, until she finds out. I mean, what's the long term plan?",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,The long term plan is sucky fucky.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Sucky fucky is not a long term plan!,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, how long's the cruise for? Months. Chuck her phone off the boat first day. Butter fingers. Then work on her, cement things. You're in pole position.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Hmm, she does hate her phone.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Exactly.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,I think we let him go and I take the hit.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, Mark. Sail off into the sunset and let your love butler take care of business.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Fuck it! All right. Leave him in there for now.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Correct decision. There's always a dark side of love. Someone's always gonna get a little bit kidnapped. Who's that?,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Oh. Er... surprise!,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh for fuck's sake, Mark! I told you I didn't want a fucking surprise party!",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,I thought you were just hiding your true feelings.,Hall

9,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Give him a poke.,Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,I'm not giving him a poke. I'm not a fucking hired goon. Who's on shift?,Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Mark,Mark?,Hall
9,6,Mark,Super Hans,I'm not doing a shift. This is insane.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. You're the British people. We're Blair and Bush. We'll do the rendition. You just have a glass of wine and pretend nothing's happening.,Hall

9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Why did you invite her? She hates me. I stole her boyfriend.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Sorry, but when I was doing the invites, it became clear that you've betrayed everyone you've ever been close to. I think that's why the majority declined.",Hall
9,6,Molly,Jeremy,"Hi, Jeremy.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Molly,"Oh hi, Molly.",Hall
9,6,Molly,Jeremy,Happy birthday. I guess that's what you're meant to say.,Hall

9,6,Jeremy,Joe,"Look, Joe, I'm sorry, but the truth is I'm forty, and I don't want to go raving for a week. I want to stay up till about one and then go to bed and listen to my Mr. Nice audiobook.",Living Room
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,Bed at one? One isn't even the night.,Living Room

9,6,Joe,Jeremy,You drink your own piss?,Living Room

9,6,Mark,Mark,That's probably as far as I can truthfully go on the endearment stakes.,Living Room
9,6,Mark,Others,"Um, he's not a great man. He's not a wise man. He's not always a good man.",Living Room

9,6,April,Jeremy,It's all your doing?,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,April,"Angus wanted stuff done to him. I wasn't into it. It's all pretty disgusting. I don't want to go into details, but it's complicated. We'll probably never fully understand, like Stonehenge.",Hall

9,6,Super Hans,Molly,Molly. For fuck's sake.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Mark,Who could have possibly predicted that falsely imprisoning a love rival would turn out so badly? Only a genius.,Hall

9,6,Mark,Mark,"A real night to remember, like the Titanic.",Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Right, well, it's over with Molly. Apparently I'm not even allowed to do a little fucking naughty kidnap. So bollocks to it. I'm gonna van it to Macedonia. Finally set up the moped rental.",Living Room
