        <p>It’s 1989, the decade of excess is drawing to a denouement and the Stone Roses have just released I Wanna Be Adored, the opening track on their eponymous 
            classic debut record. Whether due to the onset of digital recording, the MTV effect, or just because everything was done to the extreme in the ‘80s, the 
            decade was a high watermark for the song intro, where a tune builds up slowly toward an opening crescendo before the vocal kicks in.</p>

        <p>It has been claimed that thanks to streaming, 
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41500692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the age of the great song intro is 
            over</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>. Fickle music fans can now skip tracks if their attention isn’t grabbed 
            almost immediately, and with the voice being the most attention-grabbing instrument there is in music, it needs to come in much more quickly than in years 
            gone by otherwise the listener skips, and if this happens before 30 seconds has elapsed, 
            <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/help/article/how-we-count-streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            the stream doesn’t count</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> hitting artists in their pockets.</p>

        <p>That’s the theory, but I wanted to see if this holds true in the data. Below are the 30 top selling songs per year based on number of weeks spent in the 
            UK Top 10 chart arranged by date of release and the time before the vocal kicks in (beware of the scale, it isn’t linear as most songs tend to bunch 
            around the 10 second mark and this helps prevent too much overlap).</p>

        <p>Click ‘Start’ on the chart to put this into context by comparing them to the intro in ‘I Wanna Be Adored’. This requires you to login with a Spotify 
            premium account but you can still interact with the data without this.</p>

        <p>As we can see from the <span id="trend">trend</span>, the intro is definitely becoming shorter, but it’s more gradual than precipitous. Perhaps 
            we’ve always craved a quick vocal hit and streaming is just giving us more of what we want. 50% of <em>all</em> intros are over within the first 6 seconds, so, 
            maybe we should hold off writing the intro’s elegy after all. I Wanna Be Adored peaked at #20 in the charts so isn’t on this list. Interestingly, some of 
            the most famous intros don’t make the cut either:</p>
        
        <p><span class="clip" id="temptations"><span class="clip-control" id="play-temptations"><i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>Papa Was A Rollin’ Stone</em> - The Temptations</span>: 
            Pure unadulterated funk and groove for nearly 2 minutes before the vocals. Peaked at #14, and didn't make the list.</p>

        <p><span class="clip" id="stones"><span class="clip-control" id="play-stones"><i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>Gimme Shelter</em> - The Rolling Stones</span>: A 50 second intro 
            of tense, menacing, distorted riffs from Richards before Jagger’s vocal captures the violent mood of the era. Peaked at #19 and not in this list.</p>

        <p><span class="clip" id="who"><span class="clip-control" id="play-who"><i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>Baba O’Riley</em> - The Who</span>: Over a minute’s worth of pulsating, 
            trance-inducing sounds before we hear the first vocal in one of the all-time classic intros. This wasn’t even released as single!</p>

        <p><span class="clip" id="new-order"><span class="clip-control" id="play-new-order"><i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>Blue Monday</em> - New Order</span>: The iconic drum 
            machine intro and throbbing bass line builds up to Bernard Sumner’s deadpan vocal, which can take quite some time depending on the version. Although 
            it was the best selling 12” of all time, it only spent 2 weeks in the Top 10, peaking at #9 and doesn’t quite make the cut.</p>

        <p>The songs that do make the cut seem to be on the shorter side in comparison:</p>

        <p><span class="clip" id="beatles"><span class="clip-control" id="play-beatles"><i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>A Hard Day’s Night</em> - The Beatles</span>: As with most 
            things, The Beatles prove to be the exception. As intros go it is incredibly short, we hear John Lennon’s vocal just after the 3 second mark, but it’s 
            the opening chord that makes this famous. Can a single chord even be classed as an intro? When it’s The Beatles it most certainly can. George Harrison’s 
            mighty opening chord is probably the most discussed intro of all time.</p>
        
        <p><span class="clip" id="jacko"><span class="clip-control" id="play-jacko"><i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>Billie Jean</em> - Michael Jackson</span>: Minimal instrumentation 
            builds up slowly in this classic pop intro. We get the opening drum beat with a standard hi-hat, joined by a shaker, bassline and synth towards the 
            quiet vocal start at the 30 second point.</p>

        <p><span class="clip" id="summer"><span class="clip-control" id="play-summer"><i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> <em>I Feel Love</em> - Donna Summer</span>: The hypnotic Giorgio 
            Moroder bassline and sweeping synth still sounds cutting edge over 40 years later. In the single version the vocal enters just after 30 seconds.</p>

        <p>Technology having an effect on the music industry isn’t exactly new and noteworthy, but we can see a definite <em>gradual</em> decline in the length of time before 
            the vocals start, and streaming, with its concomitant demands on listener attention, must be a factor. However, it wasn’t as if the super-long, drawn-out 
            intro à la “I Wanna Be Adored” was hugely popular in the past, perhaps this type of intro has always been within the purview of 
            <abbr title="Album-oriented rock">AOR</abbr> and <abbr title="like myself :)">closet music snobs</abbr> making claims to music’s decline. There are still plenty of recent anomalies (Billie 
            Eilish, The Weeknd, any new James Bond theme song) and there have been peaks and troughs in the past perhaps suggesting that this might not be a permanent 
            decline and streaming, like anything in the economy, is just providing more of what people want.</p>

        <h2>Do I Have Your Attention?</h2>

        <p>I've had this nagging feeling for some time that streaming has fundamentally altered the way I consume music. Just recently the annual Spotify “wrapped” report 
            hit my inbox and it dawned on me that there were no albums, just a loose collection of individual tracks. As a music lover, nay, adorer, I couldn't believe 
            that I'd been sucked into this mode of consumption. Back in the fat days I couldn't wait to go out and buy the latest album, usually on the orders of the 
            NME. Some of my favourite records didn't strike a chord at first listen, it was only after repeated hours that they finally hit, and it was so much more 
            rewarding. So how had I let this situation come to pass? It's down to something dubbed <em>attention economy</em>. The decline of the intro, which we have already 
            looked at, formed part of a wider study into the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1029864917698010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            theory of attention economy on listener attention by Hubert Léveillé Gauvin at Ohio State University</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>.</p>

        <p>The study showed that the situation is driven by streaming services where due to the sheer volume of music available at your fingertips, coupled with the 
            ability to instantly skip songs, artists are now facing much higher levels of competition for listeners’ attention, and attention is the scarcest of 
            scarce commodities. In the vinyl days the barrier was higher as it took more effort to go over and switch records. This became easier in the cassette/CD 
            era but you still had to physically switch, plus with physical mediums you had to make a choice as a consumer to part with your hard-earned for a particular 
            record, now the entire catalogue is at your mercy and if you get bored, you just skip. The barrier hasn't just lowered, it has been obliterated.</p>

        <p>This is common knowledge across the internet and is analogous to the back button in a web browser impacting attention spans on websites, but when it 
            comes to music the study showed that it is in-fact a 2-stage screening process. The first being after 5 seconds as a “first-pass” 
            (<a href="https://musicmachinery.com/2014/05/02/the-skip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24% of all Spotify plays were skipped within the first 5 
            seconds</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>), and the second stage after 20 seconds as most skips happen within this 
            period, after this there is a relatively small but steady skipping rate. Only 52% of songs were listened to in their entirety. With revenue relying on stream 
            counts, and streams not counting until someone listens for a minimum of 30 seconds, it is vital that the fickle listener’s attention is grabbed almost 
            immediately. The impact of the internet on the music industry is huge, so I wasn't sure why this was such a surprise, I suppose I was like the proverbial addict, 
            tricking myself into believing I had it under control but in reality, the medium is the message and I was at the mercy of the medium all along.</p>

        <p>As well as the decline of the intro, this and a similar study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looking 
            at the evolution of music</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> identified other possible ways of measuring the attention economy in music.

            <p id="attention-economy-explanation">There has been a recent tendency for popular songs to have short titles with Billboard Magazine giving them 
                the moniker of “One-Word Wonders”. Today, it is two and a half times more likely that a hit has a one-word title than back in the 60s. We see a 
                steep decline in the average number of words from the turn of the millennium, possible coinciding with the rising importance of single sales 
                over albums. Why? The theory is that memory span is inversely related to word length, consequently shorter titles should be more memorable 
                and better commercially as a result.</p>
