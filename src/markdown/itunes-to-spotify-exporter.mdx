### Who?

Me... obvs.

### What?

An app that reads an iTunes library and creates equivalent playlists in Spotify.

### Where?

Hosted on Heroku [here](https://itunes-to-spotify-exporter.herokuapp.com/).

### When?

Last updated on 8th January 2017. I am aware of [a few issues](https://github.com/Poc275/iTunes-to-Spotify/issues) as of late due to some changes 
in the Spotify API which I'll try and fix ASAP. Feel free to fork/branch and fix them yourself!

### Why?

I had a situation where I had two repositories of music, one in iTunes for music that I had purchased, and one in Spotify for streaming. The 
latest iOS update made the music app look terrible, so I decided to combine the two in Spotify, but I didn't want to recreate playlists containing 
over 15,000 songs manually.

### How?

1. Click the button to log in to Spotify.
1. Export your iTunes playlists/library in .xml format: File > Library > Export Libraryâ€¦/Export Playlistâ€¦
1. Upload the .xml file (don't worry, it isn't stored on the server so I can't judge your music taste ðŸ˜‰).
1. Export the playlist/s to Spotify.
1. ðŸŽ§ (Optional)
